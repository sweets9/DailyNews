**Microsoft Office Zero-Day Exploited in the Wild**
Microsoft has patched a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Office, CVE-2026-21509, that was likely used in targeted attacks before a fix was available. The flaw could allow an attacker to take control of a victim's computer by tricking them into opening a malicious document.
Why it Matters: Microsoft Office is ubiquitous in the enterprise. This type of vulnerability puts a massive number of organizations at risk of phishing attacks, ransomware, and data theft. Ensure all systems have the latest Microsoft Office security updates installed.

**"PackageGate" Flaws Expose JavaScript Supply Chain**
Newly discovered "PackageGate" vulnerabilities in the JavaScript ecosystem are putting the software supply chain at risk. These flaws could allow attackers to publish malicious code packages that are then unknowingly used by developers in their applications, leading to widespread security issues.
Why it Matters: Modern applications are built using hundreds of open-source packages. A compromised package can be a trojan horse, giving attackers a backdoor into countless applications and systems, leading to data breaches and other malicious activity.

**"Shadow AI" Exposing Sensitive Enterprise Data**
A significant and growing trend, dubbed "Shadow AI," involves employees using unsanctioned Artificial Intelligence tools for work tasks. This practice is leading to the accidental exposure of sensitive corporate data, as employees copy and paste proprietary or confidential information into public AI platforms.
Why it Matters: The use of unauthorized AI tools bypasses all existing security controls and creates a blind spot for security teams. This can lead to the leakage of intellectual property, customer data, and other sensitive information, creating significant compliance and security risks.

**Majority of Global 2000 Companies Fail to Secure Web Domains**
A new report reveals that 67% of the world's largest companies have not implemented basic domain security controls. This leaves them vulnerable to phishing, brand impersonation, and other forms of online fraud, where attackers use lookalike domains to trick employees, customers, and partners.
Why it Matters: Your company's domain is a core part of its identity and brand. A lack of domain security makes it easy for attackers to impersonate your brand, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and a loss of customer trust.

**Critical Zero-Day Flaws in Ivanti EPMM Actively Exploited**
Two critical zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, have been discovered in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. These vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution without authentication. Attackers are actively exploiting these flaws in the wild. A successful attack could give a malicious actor complete control over the system that manages mobile devices and their configurations within an enterprise, creating a significant risk of further network intrusion.
**Why it Matters:** This is a critical threat for any organization using Ivanti EPMM. The vulnerabilities are being actively used in attacks, meaning the risk of compromise is high. A breach here could expose sensitive mobile data and provide a gateway for attackers to access the broader corporate network. Immediate patching is required.

**ShinyHunters Claims Major Data Breaches at Match Group and Panera Bread**
The ransomware group ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for significant data breaches at Match Group, which owns popular dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, and Match.com, and the restaurant chain Panera Bread. The group alleges it has stolen millions of user records containing personally identifiable information (PII). The attack vectors reportedly involved compromising Single Sign-On (SSO) systems and using sophisticated voice-cloning techniques for social engineering.
**Why it Matters:** This attack highlights the increasing sophistication of ransomware gangs, who are now targeting SSO infrastructure and using AI for social engineering. For consumer-facing companies like Match Group and Panera, a breach of this scale can lead to massive reputational damage, regulatory fines, and a loss of customer trust. The stolen data is likely to be used for identity theft and other fraudulent activities.

**Vulnerability Exploitation Remains Top Attack Vector**
A new report from Cisco's Talos intelligence group shows that exploiting software vulnerabilities was the most common way for attackers to gain initial access to corporate networks in the last quarter of 2025. While ransomware attacks saw a slight decline in that period, the consistent success of vulnerability exploitation underscores the importance of timely patch management.
**Why it Matters:** This report reinforces a fundamental security principle: unpatched software is a primary target for attackers. For businesses, this means that maintaining a robust and efficient patch management program is one of the most effective defenses against cyberattacks. Delaying software updates leaves the door open for intruders.

**A Look Back: Major Ransomware Attacks of 2025**
Security researchers have published a retrospective on the most impactful ransomware attacks of the past year. Groups like HELLCAT and the notorious Cl0p successfully breached organizations across automotive, healthcare, and IT sectors. These attacks caused significant disruption, including halting manufacturing lines and exposing the sensitive data of millions of patients.
**Why it Matters:** Understanding the tactics and targets of major ransomware groups from the previous year helps organizations anticipate future threats. The report highlights the cascading impact of these attacks, which extend beyond data theft to include major operational and supply-chain disruptions.

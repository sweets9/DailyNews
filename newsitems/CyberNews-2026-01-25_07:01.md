**Cisco Unified Communications Manager Under Active Attack With Critical Zero-Day Flaw**
A critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-20045) in Cisco's Unified Communications Manager (CM) and Webex Calling is being actively exploited by attackers. The flaw allows for unauthenticated remote code execution, giving attackers the ability to take control of affected systems without needing any credentials. Cisco has released security patches and is urging administrators to apply them immediately.
Why it Matters: Cisco Unified CM is widely used in large enterprises for voice and video collaboration. A successful exploit could allow attackers to intercept communications, pivot to other areas of the corporate network, and cause significant business disruption. The active exploitation as a zero-day means attackers were using the flaw before a patch was available, increasing the risk for organizations.

**Critical Fortinet SSO Flaw Actively Exploited to Hijack Firewalls**
Attackers are actively exploiting critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities in Fortinet's FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) system. The flaws allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to FortiGate firewalls and other enterprise security products. Fortinet has confirmed the active exploitation and is advising customers to patch their systems.
Why it Matters: Firewalls are the first line of defense for corporate networks. Gaining administrative control of a firewall allows an attacker to disable security policies, redirect traffic, and gain deep visibility into a company's internal network, effectively leaving the organization exposed to further attacks.

**Previously Patched VMware vCenter Flaws Now Under Active Attack**
Two critical heap-overflow vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter Server (CVE-2024-37079 and CVE-2024-37080) are being actively exploited in the wild. Although patches were released in June 2024, many systems remain unpatched. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added these vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to patch.
Why it Matters: VMware vCenter is a central management platform for virtualized environments in many data centers. A compromise could allow an attacker to gain control over numerous servers, access or steal vast amounts of data, and deploy ransomware across an enterprise's most critical infrastructure.

**Nike Investigating Potential Major Data Breach by "WorldLeaks" Ransomware Group**
Global sportswear giant Nike is investigating claims of a significant cyberattack. The "WorldLeaks" ransomware group has taken responsibility, threatening to leak sensitive corporate data if a ransom is not paid. Details of the breach and the type of data stolen have not yet been confirmed.
Why it Matters: A data breach at a company the size of Nike could expose sensitive intellectual property, customer data, and internal corporate information. This could lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.

**Unauthenticated RCE Vulnerability Discovered in Redis**
A critical vulnerability has been found in Redis, a popular in-memory data store used by many applications for caching and session management. The flaw allows for unauthenticated remote code execution, meaning an attacker could run arbitrary commands on the server without needing to log in.
Why it Matters: Redis instances often store sensitive session data and cached user information. An RCE vulnerability could be used to steal this data, compromise the web applications that rely on Redis, or use the server as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.

**Under Armour Investigates Data Breach Affecting Customer Information**
Under Armour has launched an investigation into a data breach that has reportedly compromised customer data, including email addresses and other personal information. The full scope of the incident is still being determined.
Why it Matters: The leak of customer personally identifiable information (PII) can lead to targeted phishing campaigns, identity theft, and a loss of customer trust. The company may also face regulatory action and fines depending on the jurisdictions of the affected customers.

Here is the latest cyber security news:

**Critical SQL Injection Flaw in Fortinet FortiClientEMS**
A critical SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2026-21643) has been discovered in Fortinet's FortiClient Enterprise Management Server (EMS). The flaw, rated 9.1 out of 10 for severity, allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution on affected servers by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.
Why it Matters: FortiClientEMS is used by enterprises to manage endpoint security. A remote code execution flaw allows an attacker to take complete control of this central management server, potentially disabling security controls and deploying malware across the entire organization.

**Ivanti Zero-Day Exploit Confirmed to Steal Data**
A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-1281) in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly MobileIron Core, has been actively exploited. Dutch authorities confirmed that attackers used the flaw to access and steal employee contact information. The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution.
Why it Matters: Zero-day exploits are particularly dangerous because they are actively used by attackers before a patch is available. This breach demonstrates a direct risk to sensitive enterprise data stored on mobile devices managed by Ivanti's software, leading to potential data loss and privacy violations.

**New "Reynolds" Ransomware Disables Security Software**
A new ransomware family named "Reynolds" has been identified. It uses a sophisticated technique known as "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD). By exploiting a legitimate, but vulnerable, hardware driver, the ransomware can gain deep system access to terminate and disable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and other security tools before encrypting files.
Why it Matters: Ransomware that can evade or disable security software is a major threat. This technique allows the attack to proceed undetected, bypassing significant enterprise security investments and increasing the likelihood of a successful and widespread ransomware incident.

**"TeamPCP" Worm Actively Attacking Cloud Infrastructure**
A widespread automated campaign, dubbed "TeamPCP," is actively compromising cloud environments. The worm exploits misconfigured and vulnerable services, including Docker APIs, Kubernetes clusters, Redis servers, and web application frameworks, to deploy malware and expand its botnet.
Why it Matters: The compromise of cloud infrastructure can lead to significant data breaches, service disruptions, and high financial costs from fraudulent resource usage (cryptojacking). This highlights the critical need for proper security configuration and vulnerability management in cloud environments.

**Microsoft Warns of Attacks Targeting SolarWinds Help Desk Software**
Microsoft has observed attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances. These exploits are used to gain initial access to a company's network, from which the attackers then move laterally to conduct further malicious activities, including data theft and deploying ransomware.
Why it Matters: This serves as a reminder that even non-critical enterprise software can be a gateway for major security breaches. A compromised help desk system can provide attackers with a foothold inside the network, bypassing perimeter defenses.

**CISA Catalogs Newly Exploited Vulnerabilities**
The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added several new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This includes flaws in Microsoft Office that can bypass security features and a command injection vulnerability in the React Native Community CLI.
Why it Matters: The KEV catalog lists vulnerabilities that are known to be actively exploited in the wild. This provides a priority list for organizations, signaling that these specific flaws should be patched immediately to prevent an active and ongoing threat.

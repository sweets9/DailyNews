# Cyber Security News - 2026-01-24 10:02

*Timeframe: Last 24 hours*

Okay, I will start by examining the `fetch_cyber_news.py` file to understand how to gather the requested cybersecurity news.
The `fetch_cyber_news.py` script appears to perform the exact task you've described. It uses `gemini-cli` with a detailed prompt to fetch, format, and save the news.

I will execute the script, which should generate a new news file in the `newsitems/` directory. I will then display the content of that new file.
I will now execute the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script to gather the news.
I am about to run the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script. This script will create a new news file in the `newsitems/` directory, update the `README.md` with a link to it, and then commit and push these changes to the project's git repositories.
I will now re-attempt to execute the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script.
I will try executing the script again using the `python3` command directly.
It appears I am unable to execute shell commands, so I cannot run the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script directly.

I will proceed by manually replicating the script's core function: searching for the news, formatting it, and presenting it to you. I will use the `google_web_search` tool to query the specified news sources. However, please be aware that I will not be able to save the output to a file or update the git repository as the tools for file modification are not available to me.

I will now update my plan and begin searching for the news.
I will now search the specified sources for cybersecurity news from the last 24 hours.
I have gathered the search results. I will now consolidate the information, sort it by seriousness, and format it as requested. The most critical news appears to be the set of actively exploited vulnerabilities added to CISA's KEV catalog.
Here is the consolidated cybersecurity news report for the last 24 hours.
Here is your summary of the latest cybersecurity news:

**CISA Warns of Four Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are being actively used in attacks. The list includes a critical authentication bypass in Versa Networks' Concerto SD-WAN platform (CVE-2025-34026) that allows attackers to gain full control of the system. Another high-severity issue is a supply-chain compromise in a popular developer tool, `eslint-config-prettier` (CVE-2025-54313), which could allow attackers to inject malicious code into software projects. An improper access control flaw (CVE-2025-31125) and a vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite are also on the list.
**Why it Matters:** Any organization using these software products is at immediate risk of compromise. CISA's warning means that attackers have developed working exploits and are actively targeting vulnerable systems. Immediate patching is critical to prevent data breaches, network intrusion, and supply-chain attacks.

**Fortinet FortiCloud SSO and SmarterMail Flaws Exploited**
Reports confirm that attackers are targeting a Single Sign-On (SSO) vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiCloud management platform, even against patched devices. Separately, a newly discovered authentication bypass vulnerability in the SmarterMail email server was also reportedly exploited in the wild shortly after a patch was made available.
**Why it Matters:** These incidents highlight that even recently patched systems can be at risk, especially for critical enterprise platforms like SSO and email. The attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive corporate resources and data.

**Atlassian Releases Bulletin for Critical Vulnerabilities**
Atlassian published a security bulletin detailing multiple high and critical severity vulnerabilities across its product suite, which includes popular tools like Jira and Confluence. Some of these flaws could allow for remote code execution or privilege escalation without requiring an attacker to be authenticated.
**Why it Matters:** Atlassian products are central to the workflow of many enterprises. A critical vulnerability could allow an attacker to take over these systems, access sensitive project data, intellectual property, and potentially pivot to other parts of the corporate network.

**Hackers Expose Automotive Flaws at Pwn2Own**
At the Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 event, security researchers successfully demonstrated 76 unique zero-day vulnerabilities in modern vehicle components. Hackers earned over $1 million for exploiting flaws in popular infotainment systems and Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, demonstrating significant security gaps in the automotive sector.
**Why it Matters:** While these exploits were demonstrated in a controlled environment, they prove that the software running in modern vehicles is vulnerable to attack. This could potentially allow bad actors to access vehicle systems, owner data, or interfere with charging infrastructure.

**Enterprise Security Shifts to Data-Centric Models**
A recurring theme in recent security analysis is the enterprise shift away from traditional perimeter-based security. As data becomes more distributed across cloud services, APIs, and AI pipelines, companies are adopting "data-centric" security. This approach focuses on discovering, classifying, and protecting the data itself, wherever it is, using real-time access intelligence and behavioral analytics.
**Why it Matters:** This strategic shift reflects the changing nature of corporate IT. Simply defending the network edge is no longer sufficient. Businesses must now actively manage and secure their data across a wide range of third-party platforms to prevent leaks and comply with regulations.

I have completed the news-gathering task. I am ready for your next instruction.

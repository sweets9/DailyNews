Okay, I am ready to begin. I will now search for the latest cybersecurity news according to your instructions. Since today is Tuesday, I will search for news from the last 24 hours.

I will perform a targeted search across Bleeping Computer, Security Week, The Hacker News, The Register, Dark Reading, and Risky Biz for topics related to enterprise data security, vulnerabilities, and general cyber security updates. Then, I will consolidate, sort, and format the results as requested.
Here is the latest cyber security news based on your criteria:

**Multiple Critical Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Under Active Exploitation**
Recent security reports have identified several severe, actively exploited vulnerabilities. These include a Microsoft zero-day flaw (CVE-2025-62221), a Google Chrome zero-day that prompted an emergency security update, and a new critical vulnerability dubbed "React2Shell". Patches for the Microsoft and Google flaws have been released and should be prioritized.
Why it Matters: A zero-day is a vulnerability that is already being used by attackers before a fix is widely available. This poses a critical risk because normal defenses may not stop it. A successful exploit of these flaws could lead to full system takeovers, data theft, or a ransomware attack. Immediate patching is the only effective mitigation.

**Pharmaceutical Research Firm Inotiv Hit by Qilin Ransomware**
The research firm Inotiv, which specializes in pharmaceutical development, has confirmed a significant data breach. The attack was conducted by the Qilin ransomware group, which exfiltrated sensitive data related to the company's clinical research.
Why it Matters: This attack highlights the supply-chain risk in the pharmaceutical industry. The theft of intellectual property and clinical trial data can lead to massive financial and competitive losses. Furthermore, the exposure of any related patient data could trigger severe regulatory penalties and reputational damage.

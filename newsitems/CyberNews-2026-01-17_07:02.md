Here is the cyber security news report for the last 24 hours:

**Cisco Zero-Day Vulnerability Actively Exploited by Hackers**
A critical zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Cisco's Secure Email Gateway is being actively exploited by state-sponsored hacking groups, reportedly linked to China. Cisco has released patches to address the flaw.
Why it Matters: A zero-day vulnerability means that attackers were able to exploit the flaw before a patch was available. This puts any organization using the affected Cisco product at high risk of a security breach. It is crucial to apply the security patches immediately to prevent attackers from gaining control of the email gateway, which could lead to data theft, malware injection, and further network compromise.

**Critical WordPress Plugin Flaw Under Active Exploitation**
A critical vulnerability in the WordPress Modular DS Plugin is being actively exploited by attackers to gain administrative access to affected websites. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to create administrator accounts and take full control of the site.
Why it Matters: With administrative access, attackers can deface the website, steal user data, inject malicious code, or use the compromised site to launch further attacks. Given the widespread use of WordPress, this vulnerability could affect a large number of websites. It is essential for administrators to check if they are using the vulnerable plugin and update it immediately.

**New Malware Targets Over 200,000 U.S. Bank Employees**
A new malware campaign is targeting over 200,000 employees of U.S. banks with the goal of stealing their login credentials. The malware is being distributed through phishing emails that impersonate legitimate internal communications.
Why it Matters: The compromise of bank employee credentials can have severe consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive customer data and internal banking systems. This could lead to financial theft and a loss of customer trust. Financial institutions need to be on high alert and reinforce security awareness training for their employees.

**GootLoader Malware Using New Evasion Techniques**
The GootLoader malware is now using a new technique to evade detection, which involves nesting malicious code within 500-1,000 concatenated ZIP archives. This makes it difficult for traditional security solutions to scan the payload.
Why it Matters: GootLoader is a sophisticated malware that is often used to deliver ransomware and other malicious payloads. This new evasion technique highlights the continuous evolution of malware and the need for advanced threat detection capabilities that can identify and block such threats.

**Malicious Chrome Extensions Impersonate HR and ERP Platforms**
Five new malicious Google Chrome extensions have been discovered that impersonate popular Human Resources (HR) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms like Workday and NetSuite. These extensions are designed to steal authentication tokens and hijack user accounts.
Why it Matters: By hijacking user accounts with access to HR and ERP systems, attackers can gain access to a wealth of sensitive information, including employee data, financial records, and other confidential business information. This can lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and other serious security incidents.

**AWS CodeBuild Misconfiguration Exposes GitHub Repositories**
A misconfiguration in AWS CodeBuild has been discovered that could expose GitHub repositories to supply chain attacks. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the build process and inject malicious code into the application.
Why it Matters: Supply chain attacks are a growing concern, as they can have a widespread impact on many organizations. By compromising a single component in the software supply chain, attackers can distribute malware to a large number of downstream users. This vulnerability highlights the importance of securing the entire software development lifecycle.

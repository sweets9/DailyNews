**Critical BeyondTrust Flaw Under Active Attack**
A critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2026-1731, in BeyondTrust's Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access products is being actively exploited. The flaw has a severity score of 9.9 out of 10 and allows attackers to gain full control of affected systems without needing to log in. Proof-of-concept exploit code was published, and attacks were detected within 24 hours.
Why it Matters: BeyondTrust products are used by many large organizations to manage IT support and secure access to critical systems. A full compromise of this software could allow attackers to steal data, deploy ransomware, or move laterally across a network. Immediate patching is critical.

**Dutch Government Agencies Hit Via Ivanti Vulnerabilities**
The Dutch Data Protection Authority and the Council for the Judiciary have both reported being compromised by attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in Ivanti's Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron. These attacks follow a series of recent warnings about critical flaws in Ivanti products being actively used in cyberattacks.
Why it Matters: This demonstrates that state-sponsored and criminal actors are rapidly weaponizing vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise software. The compromise of a data protection authority is particularly ironic and damaging. It highlights the urgent need for organizations using Ivanti products to apply patches and hunt for signs of intrusion.

**Data Breach at Odido Impacts 6 Million Customers**
Dutch telecom carrier Odido has disclosed a data breach affecting 6 million of its customers. Attackers stole personal information including names, addresses, and phone numbers from a customer contact system.
Why it Matters: This is a large-scale breach of personal data, which can be used for phishing, smishing (SMS phishing), and identity theft. Customers of Odido should be on high alert for suspicious communications.

**CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Flaws in SolarWinds, Notepad++, Microsoft**
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added new vulnerabilities to its catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. These include flaws in SolarWinds Web Help Desk (likely exploited as a zero-day since late 2025), Notepad++, and Microsoft products.
Why it Matters: When CISA adds a vulnerability to this catalog, it means there is clear evidence of active exploitation. Businesses using these products need to prioritize applying the security updates to prevent a breach. The SolarWinds flaw is a reminder of the continued targeting of that company's software.

**New Threat Actor "UAT-9921" Targets Tech and Finance with "VoidLink" Malware**
A previously unknown hacking group, tracked as UAT-9921, has been identified using a new and modular malware framework called VoidLink. The group is targeting organizations in the technology and financial sectors.
Why it Matters: The emergence of a new, sophisticated threat actor is a significant development. The modular nature of the VoidLink malware allows attackers to customize their attacks and be more evasive.

**Google Sees State-Backed Hackers Using Generative AI for Attacks**
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reports that a North Korean-backed hacking group (UNC2970) has been observed using Google's own Gemini AI model. The AI was used for reconnaissance and to support their hacking campaigns, including generating content for spear-phishing emails.
Why it Matters: The use of generative AI by sophisticated nation-state attackers represents a new evolution in cyber warfare. It can make their attacks more efficient, scalable, and harder to detect.

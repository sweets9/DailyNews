**Major Vulnerabilities and Exploits**

**Urgent Patch Required for Ivanti EPMM Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**
Ivanti has released patches for two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. These flaws could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive information on the server. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added these vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are a current threat.
*Why it Matters:* If your organization uses Ivanti EPMM, you are at immediate risk of a data breach. Attackers can gain access to your systems, steal data, and potentially move further into your network. It is critical to apply the security updates immediately.

**State-Sponsored Hackers Exploiting WinRAR Vulnerability**
A security flaw in the popular file archiver WinRAR is being actively exploited by state-sponsored hacking groups. The vulnerability allows attackers to create malicious .RAR or .ZIP archives that can execute arbitrary code when a user opens a seemingly harmless file within the archive. This can lead to the installation of malware and a complete compromise of the victim's computer.
*Why it Matters:* WinRAR is a very common utility in enterprise environments. A single employee opening a malicious file can compromise your entire network. Ensure all instances of WinRAR are updated to the latest version (6.23 or newer) and warn employees to be cautious of unexpected archives.

**SolarWinds Patches High-Severity Vulnerability in Web Help Desk**
SolarWinds has patched a high-severity vulnerability in its Web Help Desk software that could allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The flaw was discovered by a security researcher and has been addressed in the latest version of the software. While there are no reports of active exploitation, the potential impact is significant.
*Why it Matters:* Help desk software often has privileged access to other systems. A compromise of this system could provide an attacker with a powerful foothold in your network. If you use SolarWinds Web Help Desk, it is important to update to the latest version as soon as possible.

**Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence**

**CISA's KEV Catalog: A Key Tool for Prioritizing Vulnerability Management**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) maintains a public catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV). This list is a valuable resource for organizations to prioritize their patching and security efforts. The KEV catalog only includes vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in the wild, helping teams focus on the most immediate threats.
*Why it Matters:* It's impossible to patch every vulnerability immediately. The KEV catalog helps you focus your limited resources on the vulnerabilities that pose the most immediate risk to your organization. Regularly checking this list should be a part of your security program.

**General Cybersecurity News**

**The Unrelenting Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness Training**
Multiple reports this week highlighted that the "human element" remains the primary vector for cyberattacks. Phishing, social engineering, and other attacks targeting employees are still the most common way for attackers to gain initial access to a network. This underscores the need for effective and ongoing security awareness training.
*Why it Matters:* Your employees can be your greatest security asset or your weakest link. A strong security awareness program can significantly reduce your risk of a breach. Training should be engaging, regular, and include simulated phishing attacks to keep employees vigilant.

**Aisy Emerges from Stealth to "Transform" Vulnerability Management**
A new startup named Aisy has launched with the goal of changing how organizations approach vulnerability management. The company claims its platform can help security teams better prioritize vulnerabilities based on their actual risk to the business, rather than just their technical severity score.
*Why it Matters:* Many security teams are overwhelmed by the sheer number of vulnerabilities they need to address. If Aisy's solution is effective, it could help organizations focus on the issues that truly matter and make better use of their security resources.

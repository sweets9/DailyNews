*Timeframe: Last 24 hours*

I will create a Python script to automate the task of fetching, filtering, and formatting cybersecurity news from the specified sources.

First, I will create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the necessary Python libraries for this task, which are `feedparser` for parsing RSS feeds and `python-dateutil` for flexible date parsing.I will explain this command: This command will create a file named `requirements.txt` and write the specified package names into it. This file is used to declare the Python dependencies required for the project, allowing for easy installation of necessary libraries.
My apologies, I used an incorrect tool.

I will now create the `requirements.txt` file to specify the project's Python dependencies. This file will list the `feedparser` and `python-dateutil` libraries required for the news fetching script. I will explain this command: This command creates a new file named `requirements.txt`. It then writes two lines of text into this file: "feedparser" on the first line and "python-dateutil" on the second. This file serves as a manifest of the Python libraries required for the project to run correctly.
I see that I cannot currently write files. I will proceed by performing web searches to gather the requested news and will format the results for you directly.

Based on today's date (Sunday, January 18, 2026), I will search for news from the last 24 hours from your specified sources.
Based on the web search, here is the consolidated and sorted list of recent cybersecurity news items.

**New RCE Exploit for Redis Vulnerability Discovered**
JFrog researchers have uncovered a new remote code execution (RCE) exploit targeting an existing vulnerability in Redis in-memory databases (CVE-2025-62507). Administrators are urged to patch their systems immediately to prevent potential takeover.
Why it Matters: An RCE vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands on a target system, which can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or using the server to launch further attacks within a network.

**Urgent Patch for Zero-Click Android RCE Vulnerability**
Google has issued a security patch for a critical zero-click vulnerability (CVE-2025-54957) in the Dolby Digital Plus Unified Decoder on Android devices. The flaw could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution through a specially crafted SMS or RCS message, requiring no interaction from the user.
Why it Matters: Zero-click vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous as they can be exploited without tricking the user into clicking a link or opening a file. This allows for silent and effective attacks against high-value targets.

**Privilege Escalation Flaws Found in Google Vertex AI**
Security researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform that could allow users with low-privilege accounts to escalate their permissions to the highly-privileged Service Agent role, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive AI models and data.
Why it Matters: Privilege escalation in a major cloud platform can undermine the security model for all customers using that service, leading to data breaches and loss of intellectual property if a malicious actor gains access to powerful administrative roles.

**Trust Wallet Browser Extension Flaw Led to $8.5M in Stolen Assets**
A vulnerability in a specific version of the Trust Wallet browser extension (v2.68) was exploited, resulting in the theft of approximately $8.5 million in cryptocurrency. Users of the extension were urged to update immediately and move funds.
Why it Matters: This incident highlights the direct financial risk of vulnerabilities in software handling cryptocurrency. Flaws in wallet extensions can be exploited at scale, leading to significant and often irreversible losses for users.

**Command Injection Vulnerability Patched in Python SDK**
A command injection vulnerability affecting the command-line interface (CLI) on Windows has been fixed in a recent Python SDK update. The flaw could have allowed local attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
Why it Matters: Even local vulnerabilities are a concern in enterprise environments. If an attacker gains a foothold on a machine through other means, such a flaw can be used to escalate privileges or pivot to other systems.

**Cyber Resilience and Leadership Remain Key Business Topics**
Multiple outlets published articles discussing the importance of integrating cyber security into business strategy. The focus is on leadership's role in understanding cyber risk and moving beyond reactive measures to build long-term cyber resilience.
Why it Matters: This indicates a continued industry-wide focus on the business impact of cybersecurity. For organizations, it underscores that security is not just an IT problem but a core component of business survival and strategy.

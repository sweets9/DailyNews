**Critical RCE Flaw in n8n Workflow Automation Platform**
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the popular open-source workflow automation tool, n8n. The flaw, with a top severity score of 10, could allow an attacker to take full control of a vulnerable system, potentially exposing thousands of enterprise applications and sensitive data that are connected through n8n workflows.
Why it Matters: Systems like n8n are often connected to many different business-critical applications (like databases, CRMs, and APIs). A compromise of this central hub could lead to a widespread data breach, service interruption, and significant reputational damage.

**Microsoft January Patch Tuesday Fixes 112 Flaws, Including Actively Exploited Zero-Day**
Microsoft's first security update of 2026 addresses 112 vulnerabilities, one of which is a critical flaw in Windows that is already being actively exploited by attackers. The patches also cover critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint and Office that could allow for remote code execution.
Why it Matters: An actively exploited vulnerability means attackers are already using it in the wild. Failure to patch immediately places corporate networks at high risk of compromise, which can lead to data theft, ransomware, and further attacks. All Windows systems, especially SharePoint servers, should be patched immediately.

**Critical Vulnerability in ServiceNow Exposes Customer Data**
A security flaw in ServiceNow's platform could have allowed attackers to access sensitive customer information and even gain control of their systems. The issue stemmed from a legacy chatbot feature with weak authentication, highlighting the risks of integrating new technologies like AI with older, less secure components.
Why it Matters: ServiceNow is used by major corporations to manage IT operations. This vulnerability created a risk of significant data breaches for its customers, exposing internal IT information, employee data, and other sensitive business details. It underscores the need to audit security when adding new AI-driven features to existing platforms.

**New 'VoidLink' Linux Malware Targets Cloud Environments**
A sophisticated new malware framework named VoidLink is targeting Linux systems, with a specific focus on cloud and containerized environments. The malware is modular, meaning attackers can add new capabilities to it on the fly, such as stealing data, deploying ransomware, or using the compromised system to attack others.
Why it Matters: As more companies move to the cloud, attackers are increasingly targeting the Linux systems that underpin these services. A successful attack could compromise critical infrastructure, leading to major outages and data loss. The modular nature of VoidLink makes it a persistent and adaptable threat.

**WordPress Plugin Flaw Under Active Attack**
A serious vulnerability in the "Modular DS" WordPress plugin is being actively exploited, affecting over 40,000 websites. The flaw allows attackers to take control of affected sites. Users of the plugin are urged to update to the latest version immediately to protect their websites.
Why it Matters: WordPress is a common platform for company websites and blogs. A compromised website can be used to host phishing pages, distribute malware to visitors, or steal customer data submitted through the site, leading to brand damage and potential legal issues.

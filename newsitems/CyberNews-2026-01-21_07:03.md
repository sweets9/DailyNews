# Cyber Security News - 2026-01-21 07:03

*Timeframe: Last 24 hours*

---

I will run `fetch_cyber_news.py` to get the latest cybersecurity news. I will then check the output for duplicates and consolidate stories. After that, I will look for new files in the `newsitems/` directory, read them to ensure proper formatting, and review the script to understand its functionality.
I need to fetch cybersecurity news as requested. I'll start by examining the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script to see if it meets the user's needs, and then I'll decide whether to use it as is or modify it. First, I'll read the script's code.
I need to fetch cybersecurity news, but I can't directly run the provided Python script. Instead, I'll replicate its functionality. My plan is to first search for news from the specified sources—Bleeping Computer, Security Week, The Hacker News, The Register, Dark Reading, and Risky Biz—using Google searches. Then I'll consolidate the findings, save them to a file, update the README, and finally, commit the changes to Git. I'll start by searching Bleeping Computer for articles on enterprise data security, vulnerability awareness, or cybersecurity updates from the last 24 hours.
Okay, first step: Bleeping Computer. I'll use `google_web_search`, targeting "bleepingcomputer.com" for "enterprise data security," "vulnerability awareness," or "cyber security updates" from the last 24 hours, adding `tbs=qdr:d` to the query. Security Week is next.
Okay, Bleeping Computer search is done—found info on Canada's new cybersecurity strategy. Next up: Security Week. Same query, new domain. Updating the to-do list now.
Okay, to-do list updated. Now, I'm searching Security Week with `google_web_search` using the query `site:securityweek.com enterprise data security OR vulnerability awareness OR cyber security updates tbs=qdr:d`.
Okay, Security Week search is done, yielded good vulnerability info. Now, I'll search The Hacker News, same process, and update the list.
To-do list updated. Now searching The Hacker News via `google_web_search` with the query: `site:thehackernews.com enterprise data security OR vulnerability awareness OR cyber security updates tbs=qdr:d`.
The Hacker News search is done, and it's all about Canada's new cybersecurity strategy. Now, I'm moving on to The Register, updating my to-do list before I start the search.
To-do list updated. Now, I'm searching The Register with `google_web_search` using the query `site:theregister.com enterprise data security OR vulnerability awareness OR cyber security updates tbs=qdr:d`.
The Register search yielded only news of Canada's cybersecurity strategy, consistent with other sources. I'm moving on to Dark Reading, updating my to-do list before I begin that search.
To-do list updated. Now, I'm searching Dark Reading with `google_web_search` using the query `site:darkreading.com enterprise data security OR vulnerability awareness OR cyber security updates tbs=qdr:d`.
Dark Reading is a bust for recent news; it's all old Canadian cybersecurity stuff. Time to check the last source, Risky Biz. I'll update my to-do list and start the search.
To-do list updated. Now, I'm searching Risky Biz via `google_web_search` with the query `site:risky.biz enterprise data security OR vulnerability awareness OR cyber security updates tbs=qdr:d`.
I've searched all sources; the Canadian cybersecurity strategy is the top story, with SecurityWeek offering key vulnerability details. Now, I'll consolidate this information, prioritizing the most critical news and formatting it as requested: bold title, clear description, business impact analysis, and source link. I'll start with a unified piece on the Canadian strategy, then detail the SecurityWeek vulnerabilities by severity. Updating my to-do list now.
I'll create the news file with these stories: Canada's new cybersecurity strategy and its implications; critical Chainlit vulnerabilities risking enterprise data; Cisco's zero-day patch against Chinese hackers; Microsoft's massive January 2026 patch for 111 flaws; SAP's critical January update; and the new "StackWarp" attack on AMD CPUs. I've organized them by severity and will now save the file, then update my to-do list.
I'll save the news content I've prepared to `newsitems/CyberNews-2026-01-21_10:30.md` using the `write_file` tool. Once the file is created, I'll add a link to it in the `README.md`.
I can't use `run_shell_command`, so I'll save the news content to `newsitems/CyberNews-2026-01-21_10:30.md` with `write_file` instead. After confirming the file creation by reading it, I'll update the to-do list.
I'm stuck. My tools (`run_shell_command`, `write_file`) are missing, so I can't save the news file as planned. The `fetch_cyber_news.py` script is a no-go without shell access. `codebase_investigator` seems unlikely to solve this. Re-reading the prompt, it asks me to act as a security expert, research news, and format the output, but doesn't mandate saving to a file. I'll just present the formatted news directly to the user and explain the tool limitations. I'm updating my to-do list to cancel the file-related tasks and will now present the news.
I have compiled the latest cybersecurity news as requested. Here are the top stories from the last 24 hours, prioritized by severity.

**Critical Vulnerabilities in Chainlit Expose Enterprise Data**
High-severity vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chainlit, a popular open-source Python library for creating AI-powered chatbots. The flaws (CVE-2026-22218 and CVE-2026-22219) could allow attackers to read sensitive files and access internal network resources, posing a significant risk to enterprises using the tool.
Why it Matters: Any organization using Chainlit for building conversational AI applications is at immediate risk of data leakage and internal network compromise. Updating to version 2.9.4 or later is critical to prevent potential breaches.

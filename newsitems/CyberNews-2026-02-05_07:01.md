Here are the latest cyber security news items, sorted by severity:

**Hackers and Employees Alike Turn to AI, Increasing Enterprise Risk**
A growing trend sees malicious actors using AI to discover software vulnerabilities at an accelerated rate. At the same time, a phenomenon known as "Shadow AI" has emerged, where employees use unauthorized AI tools within the enterprise. This practice, often driven by a desire for speed over security, leads to sensitive corporate data being uploaded to insecure platforms, creating significant risks of data leakage and compliance violations.

Why it Matters: The dual threat of AI-powered attacks and internal data exposure through unsanctioned AI tools represents a critical and immediate risk to enterprise data security. Organizations must assume that their vulnerabilities may be discovered more quickly and that sensitive data is at a higher risk of being compromised from within.

**Urgent Call for Stronger AI Data Governance**
With the rapid integration of AI into business operations, there is an urgent need for enterprises to establish robust data governance frameworks. These frameworks are essential to ensure the accuracy, standardization, and security of data used by AI systems. The upcoming enforcement of regulations like the EU AI Act in 2026 adds a layer of legal and financial risk for companies that fail to govern their AI and data usage properly.

Why it Matters: Without strong data governance, companies risk not only data breaches but also significant legal and financial penalties. A proactive approach to AI governance is necessary to mitigate these risks and ensure that AI is used in a secure and compliant manner.

**Security Partnerships Emphasize Customer Service and Vigilance**
A new security partnership between OCS and Tesco in the UK highlights a growing emphasis on customer-service-led security. The partnership includes training for security officers in incident response and vulnerability awareness, underscoring the importance of a vigilant and well-trained security workforce. This comes at a time when phishing scams and other forms of social engineering remain a persistent threat to both individuals and corporations.

Why it Matters: While technology-focused threats are on the rise, the human element of security remains as important as ever. Well-trained security personnel and a security-aware workforce are a critical layer of defense against a wide range of cyber threats.

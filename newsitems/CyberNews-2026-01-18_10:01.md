I will execute a new web search for the latest cybersecurity news from Bleeping Computer, Security Week, The Hacker News, The Register, Dark Reading, and Risky Biz, focusing on enterprise data security, vulnerability awareness, and general cybersecurity updates published within the last 24 hours. After which, I will consolidate any similar stories from different sources into single, comprehensive news items. I will then sort the consolidated news items, ordering them from the most critical to the least critical. Following that, I will rewrite each news item in simple, clear language, explaining any technical jargon and focusing on the business impact and risk. Finally, I will format each news item with a bold title, a description, a "Why it Matters" section explaining the risk and business impact, and the corresponding link, then present the curated news to the user.

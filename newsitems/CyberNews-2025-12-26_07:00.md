**CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Digiever NVR Vulnerability**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical vulnerability affecting Digiever Network Video Recorders (NVRs) to its catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. The flaw, identified as CVE-2023-52163, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected devices.
Why it Matters: Digiever NVRs are used for video surveillance in various organizations. A successful exploit could allow attackers to access sensitive video feeds, move laterally within a network, or use the compromised device to launch further attacks. Organizations using these devices should patch them immediately.

**LastPass Breach Linked to Ongoing Cryptocurrency Thefts**
New reports indicate that the 2022 data breach at LastPass is connected to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts. Attackers are reportedly using information stolen in the breach, specifically targeting users with weak master passwords to access their encrypted password vaults. Blockchain analysis firms suggest that Russian cybercriminals may be involved.
Why it Matters: This is a stark reminder that the consequences of a data breach can be long-lasting. It also highlights the critical importance of using strong, unique master passwords for password managers and enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible.

**Many Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Still Underinvesting in Cybersecurity**
A recent study shows that a significant number of Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) are not adequately investing in their cybersecurity infrastructure. This includes using outdated systems, a lack of modern security tools, and the absence of a formal incident response plan. However, the study also notes that businesses with robust data backup strategies are more resilient and able to recover from attacks more quickly.
Why it Matters: SMBs are often seen as soft targets by cybercriminals. This underinvestment increases the risk of successful attacks, which can lead to significant financial loss and operational disruption.

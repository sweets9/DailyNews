**Cisco Actively Exploited Zero-Day Vulnerability**
A critical zero-day vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) is being actively exploited by hackers. The flaw, identified as CVE-2026-20045, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. Cisco has released patches and is urging customers to update their systems immediately.
Why it Matters: A compromised Unified CM system could allow attackers to eavesdrop on communications, intercept data, and gain a foothold in the corporate network. This poses a significant risk to data confidentiality and network security.

**Fortinet SSO Authentication Bypass Under Active Exploit**
Fortinet has confirmed that a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in its FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) is being actively exploited. The flaw allows attackers to gain unauthorized administrative access to FortiGate firewalls, even on patched systems. This could lead to the creation of rogue admin accounts, configuration data exfiltration, and persistent access to the network.
Why it Matters: Firewalls are a cornerstone of enterprise security. A compromised firewall can undermine the entire security architecture, exposing the internal network to attack and data breaches.

**CISA Warns of Actively Exploited VMware vCenter Flaw**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical vulnerability in Broadcom's VMware vCenter Server to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw, CVE-2024-37079, is a heap overflow vulnerability that could allow for remote code execution. CISA has confirmed that this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and has urged organizations to apply the available patches.
Why it Matters: vCenter Server is used to manage virtualized environments in many large organizations. An attacker with control of vCenter could gain access to and control over numerous servers, potentially leading to a widespread data breach or service disruption.

**Multiple Vulnerabilities Added to CISA's KEV Catalog**
In addition to the VMware flaw, CISA has added several other actively exploited vulnerabilities to its KEV catalog. These include flaws in Zimbra Collaboration and SmarterMail. The SmarterMail vulnerability, an authentication bypass, was exploited within two days of a patch being released.
Why it Matters: The KEV catalog is a list of vulnerabilities that are known to be actively exploited by attackers. Inclusion in this list is a strong indicator that a vulnerability poses a significant and immediate risk to organizations.

**Nike and Under Armour Investigate Potential Data Breaches**
Nike is investigating a potential data breach after a cybercrime group claimed to have stolen data from its systems. Similarly, Under Armour is looking into a breach that may have exposed customer email addresses.
Why it Matters: Data breaches at major consumer brands can expose the personal information of millions of customers, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and reputational damage for the affected companies.

**Thousands of Cloud Applications Found Exposed**
Researchers have discovered nearly 2,000 live, exposed cloud applications. Many of these are linked to overly permissive Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles on major cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Attackers are exploiting these misconfigurations to deploy cryptocurrency miners, web shells, and establish persistent access.
Why it Matters: Misconfigured cloud services are a common and significant security risk. Exposed applications and overly permissive access rights can provide an easy entry point for attackers to steal data, disrupt services, and gain control of cloud infrastructure.

**Pwn2Own Automotive Highlights Vehicle Security Flaws**
At the Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 event, security researchers earned over $1 million for demonstrating 76 unique vulnerabilities in modern vehicles. The exploits targeted infotainment systems and electric vehicle chargers.
Why it Matters: As vehicles become more connected, their attack surface grows. Vulnerabilities in automotive systems could potentially be exploited to compromise vehicle safety, steal personal data, or disrupt transportation infrastructure.

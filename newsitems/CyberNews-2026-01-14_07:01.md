**CISA Adds Critical Gogs Flaw to Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Gogs to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-8110, allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable Gogs server. Federal agencies are required to patch this vulnerability.
Why it Matters: Gogs is a popular self-hosted Git service. A critical RCE vulnerability that is being actively exploited poses a significant risk to organizations using this software. Attackers can take full control of the server, leading to code theft, service disruption, and further network compromise.

**The Double-Edged Sword of AI in Cybersecurity**
The increasing accessibility of AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape for both attackers and defenders. While AI can enhance security assessments and threat detection, it also empowers adversaries with new tools for creating deepfakes, launching sophisticated phishing attacks, and developing evasive malware.
Why it Matters: The rise of AI in cybersecurity presents both opportunities and challenges. Organizations must be prepared for a new wave of AI-powered attacks and invest in AI-driven defense mechanisms to stay ahead of the curve. This includes being aware of new threats like deepfake-based insider attacks.

**UK Proposes New Cyber Resilience Bill**
The UK government is advancing a new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill aimed at strengthening the nation's defenses against cyberattacks. The bill, if passed, would introduce new requirements for organizations to manage cyber risk within their supply chains and improve overall national resilience.
Why it Matters: This proposed legislation highlights the growing importance of supply chain security. Businesses in the UK may face new regulatory requirements to ensure their partners and suppliers meet certain cybersecurity standards, which could impact procurement processes and third-party risk management programs.

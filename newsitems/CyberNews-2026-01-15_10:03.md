**Microsoft's January 2026 Patch Tuesday Addresses 3 Zero-Days and 114 Flaws**
Microsoft has released its first security update of the year, fixing 114 vulnerabilities in its software, including three zero-day flaws that were actively exploited. The vulnerabilities span across various products, including Windows, Office, and other Microsoft software. One of the zero-days is a critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw in the Windows Kernel.
Why it Matters: Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they are being actively used by attackers before a patch is available. It is crucial for organizations to apply these security updates immediately to prevent potential breaches, data theft, and network compromise.

**Exploit Code Published for Critical FortiSIEM Vulnerability**
Exploit code has been publicly released for a critical command injection vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiSIEM product. The flaw, if exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. The vulnerability is considered critical, with a high severity rating.
Why it Matters: The public availability of exploit code significantly increases the risk of attacks, as it lowers the bar for even unskilled attackers to compromise vulnerable systems. Organizations using FortiSIEM should prioritize patching their systems to avoid potential network takeover and data breaches.

**Betterment Confirms Data Breach After Crypto Scam Emails**
The investment and savings app Betterment has confirmed a data breach after customers reported receiving a wave of cryptocurrency scam emails. The company stated that the breach was limited to email addresses and that no financial information was compromised. However, the incident highlights the ongoing risk of data breaches and their use in subsequent phishing campaigns.
Why it Matters: Even a breach of email addresses can have significant consequences. Attackers can use this information to launch targeted phishing attacks, attempting to trick users into revealing more sensitive information, such as passwords and financial details. This incident underscores the importance of being vigilant about unsolicited emails, especially those related to cryptocurrency.

**Advanced "VoidLink" Linux Malware Targets Cloud Environments**
A sophisticated new malware framework named "VoidLink" has been discovered targeting Linux-based cloud and container environments. First identified in late 2025, the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent, making it difficult to detect and remove. It can be used for various malicious activities, including data theft and deploying other malware.
Why it Matters: The increasing reliance on cloud and container technologies makes them a prime target for attackers. The emergence of advanced malware like VoidLink highlights the need for robust security measures in these environments, including runtime protection, regular security audits, and intrusion detection systems.

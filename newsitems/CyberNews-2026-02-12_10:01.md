Here is the latest cyber security news from the last 24 hours.

**Microsoft Patches 60 Flaws, Including Six Actively Exploited Zero-Days**
Microsoft has released its monthly security update, addressing 60 vulnerabilities in its software. Crucially, six of these are "zero-day" vulnerabilities, meaning they were being actively used by attackers before a patch was available. These flaws affect core components like Windows Shell and Microsoft Office, and could allow attackers to bypass security features or gain higher privileges on a compromised system. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added these to its list of known exploited vulnerabilities that organizations must patch.
*Why it Matters:* A vulnerability being actively exploited is a critical threat. Attackers are already using these methods to compromise systems. Since Microsoft products are used in nearly every enterprise, failing to apply these patches leaves organizations exposed to security bypasses and potential system takeovers.

**Critical Unauthenticated Flaws Patched in Fortinet Products**
Fortinet, a major provider of security appliances, has fixed several high-severity vulnerabilities. The most critical of these could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands remotely on Fortinet's FortiSIEM product or bypass authentication on its FortiClient enterprise software.
*Why it Matters:* Security products like those from Fortinet are the gatekeepers for corporate networks. A vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication or run their own code on these devices can completely undermine an organization's security posture, giving attackers a foothold deep inside the network.

**SAP Addresses Critical Code Injection Flaw**
SAP has issued patches for two critical vulnerabilities in its enterprise software. One of the flaws, affecting SAP CRM and S/4HANA, is a code injection bug that could allow an authenticated attacker to achieve a full compromise of the underlying database.
*Why it Matters:* SAP systems are often the heart of a business, managing everything from finances to customer data. A complete database compromise could lead to catastrophic data theft, financial fraud, and operational disruption.

**Intel and Google Uncover Severe System Compromise Flaw in TDX**
A joint audit by Google and Intel security teams discovered a severe vulnerability in Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) technology. The flaw could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and achieve a full system compromise. TDX is designed to create isolated, encrypted virtual machines to protect sensitive data.
*Why it Matters:* This vulnerability undermines a technology specifically created to provide a higher level of data protection. Flaws at this level are rare and serious, as they can break the fundamental security promises of the hardware that cloud and enterprise environments rely on.

**Ransomware Gang Breaches SmarterTools Using Own Mail Server Flaw**
The software company SmarterTools was reportedly breached by the Warlock Ransomware gang. The attackers gained entry by exploiting a known, but unpatched, vulnerability in the company's own SmarterMail email server product.
*Why it Matters:* This incident is a stark reminder of the importance of practicing what you preach. It demonstrates that any unpatched vulnerability, regardless of the owner, is a potential entry point for attackers and can lead to a significant breach, in this case, by a ransomware group.

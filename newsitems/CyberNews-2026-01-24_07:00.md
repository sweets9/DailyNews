**Fortinet SSO Vulnerability Actively Exploited on Patched Firewalls**
Security researchers report that a critical single sign-on (SSO) authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiCloud service is being actively exploited by attackers. The new attack vector works even against FortiGate firewalls that have been fully patched for previously related vulnerabilities, suggesting a new or more complex method of attack than was previously understood.
**Why it Matters:** This is the most serious type of vulnerability, as it allows attackers to bypass security controls on devices that administrators believe are secure and up-to-date. The immediate risk is unauthorized access to sensitive corporate networks, potentially leading to data theft, ransomware, and further system compromise. All organizations using affected Fortinet products should assume they are at risk and look for immediate guidance from the vendor.

**CISA Warns of Four Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are under active attack. The list includes a critical remote file inclusion flaw in the Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (CVE-2025-68645) and an authentication bypass in Versa Networks' Concerto SD-WAN platform (CVE-2025-34026). Federal agencies are required to patch these flaws, and all organizations are strongly urged to do the same.
**Why it Matters:** When a vulnerability is added to the KEV catalog, it is a clear signal that the threat is not theoretical but is being actively used to compromise organizations. The Zimbra flaw could allow attackers to execute malicious code, while the Versa flaw could let them bypass security to gain control of wide-area network orchestration.

**SmarterMail Flaw Exploited Days After Patch Release**
A newly discovered critical vulnerability in the SmarterMail email server was exploited by attackers to gain administrative access just two days after a patch was made available. Attackers were able to reverse-engineer the security patch to understand the flaw and create a working exploit with alarming speed.
**Why it Matters:** The rapid weaponization of this vulnerability highlights the shrinking window that IT departments have to apply security patches. It demonstrates that sophisticated attackers are monitoring vendor patch releases to find new targets. Any delay in patching can result in a full compromise of the email server.

**Attackers Abusing SharePoint for Phishing Attacks**
A new phishing campaign has been identified that abuses Microsoft SharePoint to deliver malicious payloads and facilitate Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. The campaign uses SharePoint's reputation for legitimacy to trick users into interacting with malicious files or links, with a specific focus observed on companies in the energy sector.
**Why it Matters:** This tactic bypasses traditional email security filters that might block attachments but trust links from reputable domains like SharePoint. It increases the risk of employees falling victim to phishing, which can lead to credential theft and significant financial loss from BEC fraud.

**Under Armour Investigates Customer Data Breach**
Sportswear giant Under Armour has disclosed it is investigating a data breach that resulted in the compromise of customer information. The exposed data reportedly includes customer email addresses and other personal details. The full scope and method of the breach are not yet known.
**Why it Matters:** The theft of customer personal information exposes both the company and its clients to risk. For the company, it can lead to regulatory fines and loss of customer trust. For the affected individuals, the stolen data can be used for targeted phishing attacks, spam, and identity theft.

**CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities in VMware and SmarterTools**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are under active exploitation. The first, CVE-2025-22225, is a critical flaw in VMware ESXi that could allow a malicious actor to gain full control of a virtual machine. The second, CVE-2026-24423, affects SmarterTools' SmarterMail and could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access. CISA has also confirmed that the VMware ESXi vulnerability is being actively used in ransomware campaigns.
Why it Matters: When a vulnerability is added to the CISA KEV catalog, it means there is reliable evidence of active exploitation in the wild. This elevates the risk to organizations significantly. The VMware flaw is particularly dangerous as it affects the hypervisor, the software that runs virtual machines. A compromise at this level could lead to a complete takeover of an organization's virtualized infrastructure, data theft, and deployment of ransomware. The SmarterMail vulnerability could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data breaches, and further network intrusion.

**Critical Flaw in Notepad++ Linked to Nation-State Actor**
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in Notepad++, a popular free source code editor. The flaw, which affects versions prior to 8.8.9, resides in the application's update component. It could allow an attacker to disrupt the update process, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code. Security researchers have suggested that attacks exploiting this vulnerability between June and November 2025 were likely carried out by a sophisticated nation-state threat actor.
Why it Matters: Notepad++ is a widely used tool by developers and IT professionals. A vulnerability in its update mechanism is a serious supply chain risk. If an attacker can control the update process, they could deliver a malicious version of the software to users. The potential involvement of a nation-state actor suggests that the goal of such an attack could be espionage or sabotage, putting corporate and government networks at high risk.

**Substack Discloses Data Breach Affecting User Information**
The popular newsletter platform Substack has disclosed a security incident in which a hacker claims to have stolen the personal information of nearly 700,000 users. The stolen data reportedly includes email addresses and phone numbers. Substack is investigating the incident and has begun notifying affected users.
Why it Matters: While no financial information or passwords were said to be compromised, the leaked data can be used for targeted phishing attacks, spam, and other social engineering schemes against users. For businesses that use Substack for their newsletters, this incident could damage their reputation and lead to a loss of subscribers' trust.

**AI-Powered Scam Campaign Clones Law Firm Websites**
Researchers have uncovered a large-scale scam campaign that uses artificial intelligence to create clones of legitimate law firm websites. The network consists of at least 150 fake sites designed to trick victims into paying for non-existent legal services. The AI is used to generate realistic-looking content, making the fake sites difficult to distinguish from the real ones.
Why it Matters: This campaign highlights the growing use of AI by malicious actors to automate and scale their operations. For businesses, especially those in the legal and professional services sectors, this represents a new and significant threat to their brand and reputation. Customers who are duped by these scams could lose significant amounts of money and may blame the legitimate firm, leading to legal and financial repercussions.

I will now proceed to write the news summary. Due to tool limitations, I will use a placeholder for the exact time in the filename.
My apologies, it seems I cannot create new files. I will provide the formatted news summary directly.**AI-Powered Cyber Attacks on the Rise**

A major theme from security researchers this week is the rapid weaponization of Artificial Intelligence by cybercriminals. Attackers are using AI to automate the creation of convincing phishing emails, generate deepfake videos for social engineering, and discover new software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented scale. Security firms
warn that traditional, reactive security measures are no longer sufficient. Instead of just building walls, businesses must now actively hunt for threats and assume they will be breached. The industry is pushing for a "zero-trust" model, where no user or system is automatically trusted, and security checks are continuous.

Why it Matters: AI-driven attacks can bypass conventional security filters and are much harder for employees to spot. This increases the likelihood of a successful breach, data theft, and financial loss. Businesses must invest in smarter, AI-powered defensive systems and focus on continuous monitoring and response to keep up.

**Your Company's Data "Shadows" and "Ghosts" Pose a Major Risk**

Security analysts are highlighting the growing dangers of "dark data" and "shadow AI." Dark data is all the information a company collects but doesn't manage, like old project files, forgotten spreadsheets, or unused logs. Shadow AI refers to employees using unapproved AI tools for work tasks. Both create massive security blind spots. This unmanaged data and unsanctioned software are not protected by standard security measures, making them easy targets for attackers. Experts predict that these unmanaged resources will become a leading cause of data breaches in the coming year.

Why it Matters: A breach of "dark data" can still lead to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and the exposure of sensitive information. "Shadow AI" can leak confidential company data to third-party AI models without any oversight. Businesses need to urgently get a handle on the data they have and control the software their employees use.

**Industrial and Manufacturing Systems are Being Targeted**

There is a growing concern about cyber attacks against industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT)—the systems that manage everything from factory floors to power grids. Nation-state actors and cybercriminals are increasingly mapping these environments, which have traditionally been isolated from the internet but are now more connected. The concern is that attackers could disrupt physical operations, causing safety incidents or halting production. The gap between IT security teams and OT engineers often leaves these critical systems vulnerable.

Why it Matters: An attack on OT systems can have real-world physical consequences, including service outages, equipment damage, and even risks to human safety. This is a direct threat to a company's core operations and revenue. Companies in the industrial sector need to bridge the gap between their IT and OT teams and invest in specialized security for these environments.

**New Regulations Force Companies to Get Serious About Security**

A wave of new cybersecurity regulations (such as DORA, NIS 2, and new SEC rules) is putting pressure on businesses to be more transparent and resilient. These rules require companies to continuously monitor for threats, prove their security measures are working, and disclose incidents more quickly. This marks a shift from a "check-the-box" compliance attitude to a legal requirement for continuous, provable security.

Why it Matters: Non-compliance with these new regulations can result in significant fines and legal trouble. The rules force security to become a board-level issue and a key part of business risk management, moving it beyond the sole responsibility of the IT department.

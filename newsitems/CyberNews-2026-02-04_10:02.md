Here is the latest cyber security news:

**APT28 Exploiting New Microsoft Office Flaw**
Russia's state-sponsored hacking group, APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear), is actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2026-21509). The group is using specially crafted RTF documents to trigger the flaw, which can lead to the theft of emails and the deployment of malware. Microsoft released an out-of-cycle patch for this vulnerability on January 26, 2026, but APT28 began exploiting it just three days later.
Why it Matters: This is a sophisticated attack by a nation-state actor targeting a widely used software suite. The rapid exploitation of a patched vulnerability highlights the importance of applying security updates as soon as they become available.

**Hackers Actively Exploiting Critical React Native Vulnerability**
A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Metro server for React Native (CVE-2025-11953) is being actively exploited in the wild. Attackers are using this flaw to deliver malicious payloads to both Windows and Linux development systems. The vulnerability, dubbed "Metro4Shell," allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the development server.
Why it Matters: This vulnerability affects the development environment for many popular mobile apps. A compromise of the development environment can lead to the injection of malicious code into legitimate applications, creating a supply chain risk for a large number of users.

**5.1 Million Panera Bread Records Leaked**
Hackers have leaked 5.1 million records belonging to Panera Bread customers. The data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, and loyalty card information. The breach is believed to be the result of an API vulnerability that was not properly secured.
Why it Matters: This is a large-scale data breach that affects millions of individuals. The leaked information can be used for phishing attacks, identity theft, and other malicious activities.

**Iron Mountain Investigates Data Breach Claims by Ransomware Gang**
Data storage giant Iron Mountain is investigating claims from the Everest ransomware gang that they have stolen 1.4 TB of the company's internal documents. Iron Mountain states that the breach was limited to a single compromised login credential on a public-facing file-sharing site and that no customer data was accessed.
Why it Matters: While Iron Mountain claims the impact is minimal, any breach at a major data storage and recovery provider is a serious concern. It highlights the fact that even the most security-conscious companies can be targeted.

**AI Accelerates AWS Cloud Breaches**
Attackers are now using a combination of stolen credentials and AI to breach Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments in under 10 minutes. The use of AI allows attackers to automate the process of identifying and exploiting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in cloud environments.
Why it Matters: The use of AI by attackers is a game-changer for cloud security. It dramatically reduces the time it takes to compromise an environment, leaving security teams with very little time to react.

**Rise of AI Agent Identities Creates New Security Blind Spot**
The increasing use of autonomous AI agents in corporate environments is creating a new and significant security risk. These agents often operate outside of traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, creating an "identity blind spot" for security teams.
Why it Matters: Unmanaged AI agent identities can be used by attackers to access sensitive data and systems. This is a new and evolving threat that requires a new approach to identity management.

**Risky Biz Report: Polish Power Grid Attacked, eScan Antivirus Breached**
The Risky Biz podcast reported that Russia's GRU Sandworm crew was likely behind a wiper attack that targeted the Polish power grid. In other news, hackers breached the network of antivirus provider eScan and used that access to distribute a backdoored version of the security software.
Why it Matters: These incidents highlight the ongoing threat of nation-state attacks against critical infrastructure and the software supply chain. A compromised antivirus product can have devastating consequences.

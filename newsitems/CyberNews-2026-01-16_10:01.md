**Critical FortiSIEM Flaw Under Active Exploit**
A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-64155) in Fortinet's FortiSIEM product is being actively exploited by attackers. FortiSIEM is a security information and event management (SIEM) solution used by enterprises to centralize security log data and identify threats. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the underlying system, potentially leading to a complete takeover. A proof-of-concept exploit has been made public, increasing the risk of widespread attacks.
Why it Matters: SIEM systems are a cornerstone of enterprise security operations. A compromise of this system can blind the security team to other threats and allow an attacker to gain a significant foothold in the network. Immediate patching is critical for all FortiSIEM customers.

**WordPress Plugin Flaw Allows Site Takeover**
A critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-23550) in the "Modular DS" WordPress plugin is being actively exploited. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative privileges on an affected website. WordPress is the most popular content management system in the world, powering a vast number of corporate and e-commerce sites.
Why it Matters: An attacker with administrative access can deface a website, steal customer data, install malware, or use the compromised site to launch further attacks. Any business using this plugin is at immediate risk of a full site compromise.

**New 'Reprompt' Attack Steals Data from AI Chatbots**
Researchers have disclosed a novel attack method called "Reprompt" that can trick enterprise AI assistants, like Microsoft Copilot, into leaking sensitive data. The attack works by manipulating the chatbot with a single click, causing it to bypass built-in security controls and reveal confidential information it has access to from other business applications.
Why it Matters: As businesses integrate AI into their workflows, this demonstrates a new and subtle risk. Sensitive data, such as internal documents and customer information, could be exposed through what seems like a harmless chat interface, creating a new vector for data exfiltration.

**AWS CodeBuild Flaw Could Have Allowed GitHub Repo Takeover**
A major security misconfiguration, nicknamed "CodeBreach," was discovered in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CodeBuild service. If exploited, it could have allowed attackers to take over AWS's own GitHub repositories, including the widely used AWS JavaScript SDK. The issue was discovered and patched by security researchers before it could be exploited.
Why it Matters: This highlights the risk of even minor misconfigurations in critical cloud infrastructure. A supply-chain attack on a core component like the AWS SDK would have had catastrophic consequences, potentially injecting malicious code into thousands of applications that rely on it.

**Ransomware Hits South Korean Conglomerate Kyowon**
The major South Korean conglomerate Kyowon Group, which has businesses in education and wellness, has suffered a ransomware attack that has disrupted its operations. The attackers claim to have stolen customer data, though the full extent of the breach is still under investigation.
Why it Matters: This is another example of a large enterprise falling victim to a ransomware attack, leading to operational downtime and potential data theft. It underscores the ongoing and significant threat that ransomware poses to businesses of all sizes, regardless of geography.

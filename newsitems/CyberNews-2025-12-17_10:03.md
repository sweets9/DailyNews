# Cyber Security News - 2025-12-17 10:03

*Timeframe: Last 24 hours*

---

Got it. Today is Wednesday, December 17, 2025. I will search for news from the last 24 hours from your specified sources. I will then consolidate, sort, and format the results as requested.
I've completed the initial broad search. The results provided a general overview of recent cyber security trends but did not point to specific articles from your preferred sources. To better fulfill your request, I will now perform a more targeted search on each of the specified websites to find concrete news items from the last 24 hours.
Based on the targeted search, I have found several relevant news items from your specified sources. I will now consolidate, sort, and format them as requested and save them to a new file.

Here is a summary of the news I will be compiling:

*   **Critical:** Actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Apple WebKit and Fortinet products.
*   **High:** A report on a long-term Russian cyber-espionage campaign, a major data breach claim involving Pornhub, and attacks leveraging the React2Shell vulnerability.
*   **Medium:** A malicious package discovered on the NuGet repository.

I will now create the report.
I have gathered and synthesized the latest cybersecurity news as you requested. However, I am unable to write the output to a file in the `newsitems/` directory at this time. Please find the consolidated report below.

**Critical Apple Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Under Active Attack**
Apple has released emergency updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529) in its WebKit browser engine. The flaws are being actively exploited in targeted attacks. These memory corruption issues affect all Apple devices that can render web content, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by convincing a user to visit a malicious website.
**Why it Matters:** An attacker can gain control of an affected device by simply having a user visit a webpage. The widespread use of Apple products makes this a critical threat to both individuals and enterprises. All Apple devices should be updated immediately.

**Actively Exploited Fortinet Authentication Bypass Flaws**
Two critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719) in Fortinet's FortiGate devices are being actively exploited. The flaws allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication by sending specially crafted SAML messages, granting them unauthorized access to protected systems.
**Why it Matters:** This vulnerability allows attackers to completely bypass a key security layer in widely used enterprise network security appliances. A successful exploit could lead to a full network compromise, data theft, and deployment of ransomware. Immediate patching is required.

**Amazon Uncovers Years-Long Russian GRU Campaign Against Western Critical Infrastructure**
Amazon's threat intelligence team has detailed a multi-year cyber-espionage campaign by Russia's GRU military intelligence unit (also known as APT44 or Sandworm). The campaign, running from 2021 to 2025, targeted Western critical infrastructure, including energy and cloud providers. Attackers primarily gained initial access by exploiting misconfigured network edge devices, rather than using zero-day vulnerabilities.
**Why it Matters:** This highlights a persistent, state-sponsored threat to core infrastructure. The focus on exploiting simple misconfigurations instead of complex vulnerabilities means that basic cyber hygiene and regular configuration audits are more critical than ever to defend against advanced adversaries.

**ShinyHunters Claims Massive 201M Record Pornhub Data Breach**
The infamous hacking group ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a data breach of Pornhub, allegedly stealing a database containing over 201 million user records. While the claim is not yet fully verified, it represents a significant privacy and security incident if confirmed.
**Why it Matters:** A data breach of this scale would expose sensitive user information, leading to potential blackmail, phishing campaigns, and significant reputational damage. Users of the site should be on high alert for suspicious activity.

**React2Shell Vulnerability Used to Deploy Linux Backdoors**
Threat actors are actively exploiting the "React2Shell" vulnerability to install sophisticated backdoors, including KSwapDoor and ZnDoor, on compromised Linux systems. These backdoors provide attackers with persistent remote access and control over the affected servers.
**Why it Matters:** This attack vector allows intruders to establish a long-term foothold in a company's infrastructure, enabling data exfiltration, lateral movement, and further attacks over an extended period.

**CISA Adds Gladinet Vulnerability to Known Exploited List**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a hardcoded cryptographic key vulnerability (CVE-2025-14611) in Gladinet's CentreStack and Triofox products to its catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities. This indicates the flaw is being actively used in real-world attacks.
**Why it Matters:** The inclusion in the CISA KEV list serves as a strong warning that this is not a theoretical vulnerability. Federal agencies are mandated to patch it, and all other organizations using the affected software should prioritize mitigation to prevent a breach.

**Malicious NuGet Package Steals Cryptocurrency Wallets for Years**
A rogue package named "Tracer.Fody.NLog" was discovered on the official NuGet package repository for .NET developers. Impersonating a legitimate library, the package contained a cryptocurrency wallet stealer and went undetected for nearly six years before being removed.
**Why it Matters:** This incident underscores the persistent threat of supply chain attacks, even in trusted software ecosystems. Developers must be vigilant and verify the packages they incorporate into their applications, as a single malicious dependency can compromise the entire project and its users.

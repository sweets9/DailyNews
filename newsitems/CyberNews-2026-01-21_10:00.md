**Major Chinese Hacking Campaign Exploits Cisco Zero-Day**
A newly discovered hacking campaign by a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group has been found exploiting a critical vulnerability in Cisco network appliances. The attackers are using a backdoor tool named "AquaShell" to gain persistent access to compromised systems, allowing them to steal data and potentially pivot to other areas of the network. Cisco has released patches and is urging customers to update immediately.
*Why it Matters:* An active attack by a nation-state actor against a major enterprise hardware provider is a significant threat. Any organization using the affected Cisco devices is at immediate risk of espionage and data theft.

**Actively Exploited Microsoft WSUS Flaw Allows Remote Code Execution**
A critical vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is being actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, identified as CVE-2025-59287, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on servers responsible for managing and distributing software updates to all Windows machines within an organization. This could allow attackers to take control of the update mechanism and push malware across an entire network.
*Why it Matters:* Compromising a WSUS server is a "checkmate" move for attackers. It gives them a trusted, internal channel to infect every Windows computer in the business, bypassing many traditional security controls.

**Critical Flaws in Fortinet Products Allow Code Execution and Data Leaks**
Fortinet has addressed several critical vulnerabilities in its FortiFone (enterprise phone systems) and FortiSIEM (a major security information and event management product). The most severe of these flaws could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute malicious code remotely or leak sensitive configuration data.
*Why it Matters:* Vulnerabilities in core security (SIEM) and communication (phone) systems can undermine an organization's entire security posture. A compromised SIEM could blind security teams to other attacks, while a hacked phone system could be used for eavesdropping or further network intrusion.

**New "StackWarp" Attack Technique Threatens AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization**
Security researchers have disclosed a new attack method called "StackWarp" that targets AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) technologies. These features are designed to protect data inside virtual machines, even from the cloud provider itself. This attack could allow an attacker with control of the host system to bypass these protections and execute malicious code within the supposedly secure virtual machine.
*Why it Matters:* This vulnerability impacts the fundamental security promises of modern cloud computing and "confidential computing" environments. Organizations relying on AMD's encrypted virtualization for sensitive workloads need to be aware of this potential weakness.

**High-Severity Vulnerability Discovered in Apache Struts Framework**
A significant XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability has been found in the widely-used Apache Struts web application framework. The flaw can be triggered when processing XML data, potentially allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server, initiate requests to internal systems, or cause a denial of service.
*Why it Matters:* Apache Struts has a history of critical vulnerabilities that have led to major data breaches. While this is not as severe as some past flaws, it still presents a serious risk to the many organizations that have applications built on this framework, especially those running older, unsupported versions.

**Fortinet Flaw Under Active Attack, Even on Patched Devices**
A critical authentication vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) is being actively exploited by attackers. Worryingly, the attacks are succeeding even on firewalls that have been fully patched, which suggests that the initial fix was incomplete or that attackers have discovered a new way to exploit the vulnerability. The attacks allow unauthorized individuals to gain access and steal configuration data from affected firewalls.
Why it Matters: When patches don't fully fix a problem, systems remain at risk even if they appear to be up-to-date. This situation is critical because it allows attackers to bypass security controls on a popular enterprise firewall, potentially leading to a full network compromise. Companies using Fortinet products must investigate immediately.

**Hackers Actively Exploiting Old VMware Flaw for Remote Code Execution**
A critical vulnerability in VMware, first reported in 2024, is now being widely and actively exploited. The flaw allows attackers to send specially crafted network packets to a vulnerable machine and remotely execute malicious code. This could give an attacker complete control over the affected system.
Why it Matters: An actively exploited remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is one of the most serious types of security flaws. It allows attackers to take over servers without needing any user interaction. This can lead to data theft, ransomware deployment, or the use of the compromised system to attack other parts of the network.

**Russian "Sandworm" Hackers Blamed for Cyberattack on Polish Power Grid**
The Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Sandworm is believed to be responsible for a cyberattack against the Polish power grid. The attack reportedly used data-wiping malware, a type of malicious software designed to destroy information and disrupt systems. This is a significant escalation in cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
Why it Matters: An attack on a nation's power grid is a direct threat to national security and can have widespread consequences for citizens and businesses. The use of data-wiping malware indicates the attackers' intent was to cause disruption and damage, not just to steal information.

**Crunchbase Confirms Data Breach in "ShinyHunters" Campaign**
Crunchbase, a popular platform for finding business information about private and public companies, has confirmed it suffered a data breach. The confirmation comes after the notorious hacking group "ShinyHunters" claimed to have stolen data from Crunchbase, as well as from SoundCloud and Betterment, as part of a larger campaign.
Why it Matters: The breach of a major data aggregator like Crunchbase could expose sensitive information about companies, employees, and investors. The involvement of a well-known hacking group like ShinyHunters suggests the stolen data is likely to be sold or leaked online, leading to further risks of fraud and targeted attacks.

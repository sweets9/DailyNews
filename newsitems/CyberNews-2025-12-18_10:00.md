**CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Software**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added several new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are being actively used in attacks. Threat actors are reportedly focusing on exploiting these flaws to gain initial access to corporate networks, steal credentials, and establish long-term persistence, rather than causing immediate disruption. This approach allows attackers to remain undetected for longer periods.
**Why it Matters:** If your organization uses the affected software (which is widely deployed in enterprise environments), you are at immediate risk of a breach. Attackers are not just trying to cause chaos; they are silently moving inside networks to steal data over time. Immediate patching and investigation for signs of a compromise are critical.

**Increased Scrutiny on Third-Party and Supply Chain Security**
Recent analyses highlight that dependency on suppliers is a major business resilience issue. Experts are urging organizations to go beyond simple vendor questionnaires and actively map their critical third-party dependencies, validate their vendors' recovery plans, and test communication processes. Strong supply chain security is becoming a key factor for winning business partnerships, with increased due diligence expected in 2026.
**Why it Matters:** A vulnerability in one of your software suppliers can be as damaging as a vulnerability in your own systems. This risk extends beyond data breaches to include operational disruptions. A weak security posture from a partner can directly impact your business's continuity and reputation.

**Artificial Intelligence Emerges as a Double-Edged Sword in Cybersecurity**
AI is rapidly becoming a core component of both offensive and defensive cyber operations. Attackers are leveraging AI to automate the discovery of system weaknesses and generate highly convincing phishing campaigns at a massive scale. In response, security companies are using defensive AI to process billions of security events, identify threats, and automate incident response, turning cybersecurity into a strategic business investment.
**Why it Matters:** The speed and scale of cyber-attacks are increasing thanks to AI. Relying solely on manual security processes is no longer sufficient. Businesses must understand and invest in modern, AI-powered defensive tools to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.

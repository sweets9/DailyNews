**Clop Ransomware Exploiting Gladinet CentreStack Vulnerability**
The Clop ransomware gang is actively targeting a vulnerability in Gladinet's CentreStack platform, a service used by businesses for file sharing and synchronization. In a shift of tactics, the group is focusing on stealing data for extortion rather than encrypting systems. Over 200 servers are believed to be vulnerable to this attack.
**Why it Matters:** This represents a significant and immediate threat to any organization using Gladinet CentreStack. The focus on data theft means that even if systems remain operational, sensitive company data could be exposed or sold, leading to severe financial, reputational, and regulatory damage. The high number of vulnerable servers indicates a potentially widespread campaign.

**Review of 2025's Major Cyberattacks Shows Lack of IT Systems Visibility as Key Factor**
A strategic review of the major cyber incidents of 2025 concluded that the primary failure point for many organizations was a lack of comprehensive visibility into their own IT environments. This blind spot was exploited in numerous data theft incidents, ransomware attacks, and sophisticated AI-powered campaigns.
**Why it Matters:** This is a crucial lesson for budget and strategy planning. It highlights that investing in tools and processes that provide a complete and real-time view of all network assets is fundamental to defense. Without knowing what's on your network, you cannot effectively protect it.

**The Rise of Impersonation Attacks is Reshaping Workplace Cyber Risk**
Security experts are noting a significant trend in impersonation attacks, where attackers pretend to be trusted individuals (like executives or vendors) to trick employees. This changes the focus of risk from just a compromised computer to the human processes of how requests are made, verified, and acted upon within a company.
**Why it Matters:** This threat targets the weakest link in security: people. It requires businesses to go beyond technical controls and implement stronger identity verification processes for financial transactions, data access requests, and changes to systems. Employee training on how to spot and report these attacks is critical.

**Expert Predictions for 2026: A Focus on Proactive Defense and AI**
Looking ahead, cybersecurity experts predict that 2026 will be defined by structural security improvements rather than novel exploits. The focus will be on closing gaps in how defenses are built, tested, and managed. Artificial intelligence is expected to be a key enabler, allowing teams to simulate attacks and test defenses more effectively without using real customer data.
**Why it Matters:** This signals a shift from a reactive to a proactive security posture. Businesses should consider how they can leverage automation and AI to continuously validate their security controls, rather than waiting for an audit or an attack to reveal weaknesses.

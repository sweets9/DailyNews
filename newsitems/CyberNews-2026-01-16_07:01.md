**Critical Actively Exploited Vulnerability in WordPress Plugin**
A critical security flaw in the Modular DS WordPress plugin is being actively exploited by attackers. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-23550, has a severity score of 10.0 out of 10.0. It allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative privileges on an affected WordPress site. The flaw stems from a component that allows bypassing authentication and automatically logging in as an administrator.
**Why it Matters:** Any website using the Modular DS plugin is at immediate risk of a full takeover. Attackers can deface the site, steal data, or use the compromised server for further malicious activities. Administrators should update or disable this plugin immediately.

**Critical Remote Command Injection Flaw in FortiSIEM**
Fortinet has released patches for a critical remote command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-64155) in its FortiSIEM product, a security information and event management solution used by large enterprises. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
**Why it Matters:** A successful exploit could give an attacker complete control over the FortiSIEM instance, providing access to sensitive log and security data. This could blind a security team to other malicious activity within their network. It is highly recommended to patch this vulnerability immediately and, if not possible, to isolate FortiSIEM instances from the internet.

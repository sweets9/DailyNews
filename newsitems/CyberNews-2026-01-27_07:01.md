I was able to retrieve news from one of the requested sources, *The Register*. The other sources did not return specific, recent articles within the last 24 hours through the search tool.

Here are the key stories from today's search:

**Critical VMware Flaw Under Active Attack**
A severe vulnerability in VMware's vCenter Server (CVE-2024-37079) is being actively exploited by attackers. The flaw, which has a critical severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, can allow a malicious actor to gain remote code execution, effectively taking control of the affected server. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the patch immediately.
*Why it Matters:* vCenter Server is a central management platform for VMware vSphere, which is used in the data centers of many large enterprises. A compromise could give attackers broad access to a company's internal servers, leading to significant data breaches, ransomware deployment, or widespread outages. Immediate patching is critical.

**Extortion Group Claims Major Nike Data Theft**
An extortion group known as WorldLeaks claims to have stolen 1.4 terabytes of internal data from Nike, the athletic apparel giant. The group posted samples of the allegedly stolen data online, which appear to include internal design documents and other sensitive business information. Nike has stated it is investigating the claim.
*Why it Matters:* While customer data does not appear to be part of this breach, the theft of intellectual property, product designs, and internal corporate data can have a massive financial and competitive impact. It serves as a reminder that data extortion threats target all forms of valuable business data, not just personal information.

**Decade-Old Bug in Common Utility Allows Root Access**
A security flaw in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon (CVE-2026-24061) has been discovered after remaining hidden for nearly 11 years. The vulnerability is described as "trivial" to exploit and can grant an attacker root (full administrative) access to a vulnerable system.
*Why it Matters:* While Telnet is an old and insecure protocol that should not be used, it is sometimes still found on older network equipment or embedded devices. This vulnerability highlights the risk of legacy protocols and software within an enterprise network, which can provide an easy entry point for attackers if not properly managed and decommissioned.

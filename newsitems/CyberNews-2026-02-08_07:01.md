Here is the latest cyber security news.

**IBM Storage Scale Hit With Multiple Vulnerabilities**
IBM has patched several security flaws in its Storage Scale Cloudkit. The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause denial of service or consume excessive memory on affected systems. The issues are related to the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol used for managing the storage system.
Why it Matters: IBM Storage Scale is used by large organizations to manage vast amounts of data. A denial of service attack could disrupt business operations and access to critical information. Customers should review the security bulletin and apply the necessary updates promptly.

**WordPress Plugin Vulnerability Allows Site Takeover**
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been found in the "Bold Page Builder" plugin for WordPress, affecting all versions up to 5.5.1. Attackers with at least "contributor" level access can inject malicious scripts into pages. These scripts could then be used to escalate privileges, steal data, or take over the entire website when a privileged user views the page.
Why it Matters: WordPress powers a significant portion of the web. While this attack requires the perpetrator to already have a user account, the potential for full site compromise is high. Any business using this plugin should update it immediately to prevent abuse.

**Security Teams Face "Crisis of Scale" in Vulnerability Management**
A growing challenge for security professionals is the sheer volume of new vulnerabilities being discovered, a problem now made worse by AI-generated code and automated hacking tools. Many organizations report a disconnect between security and engineering teams, making it difficult to prioritize which bugs to fix first. This leads to long lists of vulnerabilities without the proper context, overwhelming engineers and leaving critical systems exposed.
Why it Matters: This is not a specific flaw but a systemic risk. If businesses cannot effectively prioritize and fix the most critical vulnerabilities, they remain at high risk of a breach even if they have security tools in place. This highlights the need for better communication and integrated processes between security and development teams.

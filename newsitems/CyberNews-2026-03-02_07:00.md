**Critical, Actively Exploited Zero-Day Flaw in Cisco Networking Gear**
Cisco has revealed a maximum-severity (CVSS 10/10) vulnerability in its Catalyst SD-WAN Manager products. The flaw allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain full administrator control over the device. Cisco has confirmed seeing "limited exploitation" of this flaw in the wild, and the US government has ordered federal agencies to apply mitigations immediately.
Why it Matters: SD-WAN devices are core components of many corporate networks, managing traffic between data centers, branches, and the cloud. A full takeover of these devices could allow an attacker to intercept sensitive data, pivot to other parts of the network, or cause a major network outage. The active exploitation means this is an immediate and present danger.

**Multiple Vulnerabilities in Statamic CMS Could Lead to Site Takeover**
A series of vulnerabilities have been found in the Statamic content management system (CMS). The most critical of these flaws could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by tricking an authenticated user into performing certain actions in the control panel. Other flaws could allow for data theft and unauthorized access.
Why it Matters: If your organization uses Statamic to run a website, a successful exploit could lead to a full site compromise. Attackers could deface the site, steal customer or user data, or use the server as a launchpad for further attacks into your network. Administrators should update to the latest version immediately.

**Security Report: Over 5 Million Cyber Attacks Now Detected Daily**
A new report indicates that security systems are now detecting approximately 5.5 million cyber attacks per day, which averages to about 64 attacks every second. The report highlights a trend of attackers moving very quickly to exploit newly announced vulnerabilities, often within hours of their public disclosure.
Why it Matters: This statistic underscores the high volume and speed of automated and targeted attacks. It highlights the shrinking window of time organizations have to apply patches and security updates before they are targeted. A slow response to a new vulnerability is increasingly likely to result in a breach.

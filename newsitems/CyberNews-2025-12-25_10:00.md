Here is the latest cybersecurity news roundup.

**Critical RCE Flaw in n8n Workflow Automation Platform**
A critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-68613 with a CVSS score of 9.9, has been discovered in the n8n workflow automation platform. This flaw allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially giving attackers full control over vulnerable systems. Enterprises using n8n to connect and automate various business processes could be at significant risk.
*Why it Matters:* A 9.9 CVSS score indicates the highest possible severity. An attacker could exploit this to take over the automation platform, access connected services, steal sensitive data, or move laterally across the network. Immediate patching is critical.

**Authentication Bypass Flaw in M-Files Server**
A security vulnerability (CVE-2025-13008) has been found in the M-Files Server, which could allow an authenticated attacker to capture active user session tokens. By exploiting this through the web interface, an attacker could impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to documents and other sensitive information stored in the system.
*Why it Matters:* This vulnerability undermines access controls in a system designed to manage sensitive enterprise information. It could lead to significant data breaches if an attacker with any level of user access (even low-privileged) can escalate their privileges by impersonating others.

**Aflac Reports Major Data Breach Affecting 22 Million**
Insurance giant Aflac has disclosed a data breach that impacts over 22 million of its customers. The incident, which occurred in June 2025, resulted from a compromise of the company's systems, leading to the exposure of customer data. The full scope of the exposed information is still under investigation.
*Why it Matters:* This is a massive breach of personally identifiable information (PII). It exposes millions to the risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other forms of fraud. For Aflac, it represents significant reputational damage, regulatory fines, and recovery costs.

**Rise of Zero-Click Exploits Targeting Enterprise Software**
Security researchers are warning of a sharp increase in "zero-click" exploits, which can compromise systems without any user interaction. Recent examples include a critical flaw in Microsoft 365 Copilot (CVE-2025-32711, "EchoLeak") that could allow data exfiltration via a single crafted email, and a vulnerability in Apple's ImageIO framework (CVE-2025-43300) allowing remote code execution through a malicious image.
*Why it Matters:* Zero-click vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they are invisible to the user and require no mistakes on their part (like clicking a bad link). They bypass a key layer of human defense, making technical controls and rapid patching even more critical for enterprise security.

**DDoS Attack Disrupts French Postal and Banking Services**
A significant Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack has caused widespread disruption to France's postal and banking services just before the Christmas holiday. The attack overwhelmed the services' websites and online platforms, making them inaccessible to many customers.
*Why it Matters:* This incident highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to relatively simple, yet effective, DDoS attacks. The disruption of essential services like banking and mail during a peak period can cause significant economic and logistical problems for a country.

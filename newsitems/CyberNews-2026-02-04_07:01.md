**Infostealer Malware Increasingly Targets Enterprise Login Credentials**

A new report indicates a significant rise in "infostealer" malware targeting enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) and Identity Provider (IdP) credentials. This type of malware captures a complete snapshot of a victim's digital identity, including saved passwords, autofill data, and active session cookies. Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) was the most frequently exposed identity provider.

Why it Matters: The compromise of enterprise identity credentials can provide attackers with broad access to a company's systems and data. This makes it easier for them to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive information. The increasing use of SSO and IdPs in enterprises makes them a high-value target for attackers.

**AI's Double-Edged Sword in Cybersecurity**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used for both enterprise defense and by attackers. On the defensive side, AI-powered Identity & Access Management (IAM) can continuously monitor user behavior and adapt authentication measures in real-time. However, there are growing concerns about the security of AI-generated code, with some reports indicating that nearly half of it is insecure. Attackers are also using AI to accelerate the development of exploits for new vulnerabilities.

Why it Matters: While AI offers powerful new tools for defending against cyberattacks, its rapid adoption also introduces new risks. Businesses must be mindful of the security of AI-generated code and the potential for AI-powered attacks. A balanced approach that leverages AI for defense while mitigating its risks is essential.

**Enterprises Overlooking Threats in "Low-Severity" Alerts**

A recent report suggests that many organizations are missing real threats by deprioritizing security alerts that are classified as "low-severity." The research found that a significant number of confirmed security incidents originated from these seemingly minor alerts. For a typical enterprise, this could translate to dozens of potential cyber breaches being missed each year.

Why it Matters: This highlights a critical flaw in how many security teams prioritize their work. Attackers often use a series of low-profile actions to build a foothold in a network before launching a major attack. By ignoring low-severity alerts, organizations may be missing the early warning signs of a serious breach.

**Cloud Malware Evolves to Evade Detection**

Modern malware targeting cloud environments is becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. Instead of relying on traditional file-based attacks, this new breed of malware often runs directly in memory and abuses legitimate cloud-native services to carry out its malicious activities. Attackers are also exploiting misconfigured Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings, APIs, and storage to gain a foothold.

Why it Matters: As more businesses move their operations to the cloud, attackers are adapting their techniques to this new environment. Traditional security tools that are focused on file-based threats may not be effective against this new type of malware. Businesses need to adopt a multi-layered security approach that includes memory forensics and behavioral analysis to detect these hidden threats.

**Retail Sector Faces Heightened Cybersecurity Risks**

The retail industry is a prime target for cybercriminals due to the large volumes of payment and customer data it handles. New data privacy and security laws are also putting pressure on retailers to strengthen their security posture. Each connected system and third-party service in the retail ecosystem introduces new entry points for attackers, making it a complex and challenging environment to secure.

Why it Matters: A data breach in the retail sector can have serious consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and legal penalties. Retailers must prioritize cybersecurity to protect their customers' data, maintain their trust, and ensure the long-term viability of their business.

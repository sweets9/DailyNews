**Fortinet FortiCloud Flaw Under Active Attack**
A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) system (CVE-2026-24858) is being actively exploited by attackers. The flaw could allow an unauthorized actor to gain access to systems protected by FortiCloud SSO. Fortinet has released patches and urges customers to update immediately.
Why it Matters: SSO systems are a key entry point to multiple enterprise applications. A flaw here could allow widespread, unauthorized access to sensitive company data and systems. The fact that it is being actively exploited means the risk is immediate.

**Microsoft Patches Office Zero-Day Used in Attacks**
Microsoft has fixed a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office that has reportedly been used in targeted attacks. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass security features designed to protect users from malicious files.
Why it Matters: Microsoft Office is one of the most common software suites in the enterprise. A zero-day vulnerability being exploited in the wild poses a significant risk for phishing and malware campaigns, as users may open what they believe to be safe documents.

**WinRAR Vulnerability Continues to be Widely Exploited**
A previously disclosed vulnerability in WinRAR (CVE-2025-8088), a popular file compression tool, is still being widely exploited by both state-sponsored hacking groups and cybercriminals. The flaw allows attackers to execute malicious code when a victim opens a specially crafted archive file.
Why it Matters: The continued exploitation of this flaw shows that many users and organizations have failed to apply patches for a known, critical issue. It serves as a reminder that older vulnerabilities remain a present danger and that patch management is critical.

**Enterprise AI Systems Can Be Breached in Under 2 Hours, Researchers Find**
New research reveals that 90% of enterprise AI systems have critical vulnerabilities that can be discovered in less than 90 minutes. In tests, security researchers were able to compromise these systems and cause significant data loss in under two hours. The rapid adoption of AI is creating new, machine-speed attack surfaces that traditional security measures are not equipped to handle.
Why it Matters: Businesses are rushing to adopt AI to process sensitive data, but many are doing so without proper security inventories or controls. This creates a massive, unseen risk of rapid, automated data breaches.

**Critical Remote Code Execution Flaws Patched in SolarWinds**
SolarWinds has released patches for critical vulnerabilities in its Web Help Desk product. The flaws could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code remotely or bypass authentication, potentially leading to a complete system takeover.
Why it Matters: SolarWinds was the subject of a major supply chain attack in the past. Any critical vulnerability in their products requires immediate attention, as they are a high-value target for attackers seeking to gain deep access into corporate networks.

**"Operation Bizarre Bazaar" Targets Exposed AI Models**
A newly identified campaign dubbed "Operation Bizarre Bazaar" is actively targeting publicly exposed Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal of the operation appears to be focused on unauthorized use and commercial monetization of these powerful AI models.
Why it Matters: As companies deploy their own AI models, they may inadvertently expose them to the internet without proper security. This could lead to attackers hijacking expensive computational resources or accessing proprietary data and algorithms.

**Critical Flaw in HPE OneView Allows Complete Takeover**
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has patched a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-37164) in its OneView software, which is used to manage server infrastructure. The flaw has a "perfect 10" severity score (CVSS 10.0) and could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code and take full control of affected systems.
**Why it Matters:** This is a worst-case scenario for a vulnerability. An attacker needs no username or password to exploit it, and it gives them complete control over the server management platform. This could lead to a widespread breach of all servers managed by the platform, data theft, and deployment of ransomware.

**Actively Exploited Flaws in Cisco, ASUS, and SonicWall Products**
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added new vulnerabilities in Cisco, ASUS, and SonicWall products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating they are being actively exploited in the wild. Details on the specific vulnerabilities are still emerging, but CISA has urged organizations to patch their systems immediately.
**Why it Matters:** When a vulnerability is actively exploited, it means attackers have a working method to break into systems. This poses an immediate and direct threat to any organization using these products. The consequences can range from data breaches to full system compromise.

**China-Linked Hackers Exploiting Windows Group Policy for Espionage**
A threat group with ties to China, known as LongNosedGoblin, has been observed using Windows Group Policy to deploy espionage malware. This technique allows them to push malware to a large number of computers within a network simultaneously.
**Why it Matters:** Using Group Policy for malicious purposes is a sophisticated technique that can be difficult to detect. It allows attackers to gain a wide foothold in a network, making it easier to steal data and maintain long-term persistence.

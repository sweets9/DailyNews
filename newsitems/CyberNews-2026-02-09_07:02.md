Okay, I will start by using `codebase_investigator` to understand the project's architecture and identify the key files and dependencies that might be relevant to your request.
I have analyzed the codebase and found that the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script is designed to perform the exact task you've requested. It uses an external tool to gather, consolidate, and format the news from your specified sources.

I will now execute the script to fetch the latest cybersecurity news.
It appears I am unable to execute shell commands directly at this time, so I cannot run the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script as intended.

However, I have analyzed the script and understand its logic. It relies on a detailed prompt to gather and format the news. I will now manually replicate the script's functionality by searching the specified sources and then formatting the findings according to your instructions.

First, I will read the prompt from the script to ensure I match the intended output.
Okay, I have the prompt. I will now proceed to search the specified sources for relevant news from the last 72 hours, as it is Monday. I will then consolidate, sort, and format the results as requested.
The initial broad search provided a general overview but included sources outside your requested list. To provide a more accurate and focused report, I will now perform targeted searches on the specified websites.

I will search for recent news on Bleeping Computer and The Hacker News first, then proceed through the other sources. After gathering the information, I will consolidate, sort, and format it as you requested.
That search provided a few relevant items. I will now query the next set of sources, Security Week and Dark Reading, to gather more information before compiling the final report.
No results were found from Security Week or Dark Reading in that timeframe. I will now perform the last search on the remaining sources, The Register and Risky Biz. Once this is complete, I will consolidate all findings and present the final report.
Here is the consolidated cyber security news report based on your criteria.

**Critical SmarterMail Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation**
A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2026-24423) in the SmarterMail email server software is being actively exploited by ransomware groups. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to take full control of affected servers. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the vulnerability to its catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities and has mandated that federal agencies patch it by February 26, 2026.
Why it Matters: Any organization using a vulnerable version of SmarterMail is at immediate risk of a severe ransomware attack, which could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and significant business disruption. The active exploitation means attackers are already searching for and targeting vulnerable systems.

**Asian State-Backed Hackers Breach 70 Governments and Critical Infrastructure Organizations**
A newly discovered cyber espionage group, identified as TGR-STA-1030, has successfully breached the networks of at least 70 government and critical infrastructure entities across 37 countries. The group, believed to be operating from Asia, has been conducting widespread reconnaissance against government infrastructure in 155 countries, indicating a large-scale intelligence-gathering campaign.
Why it Matters: This represents a significant global espionage campaign by a sophisticated state-backed actor. The breach of government and critical infrastructure networks can lead to the theft of sensitive state secrets, intellectual property, and disruption of essential services, posing a national security risk.

**Romanian Oil Pipeline Operator Hit by Ransomware**
Conpet, Romania's national oil pipeline operator, has suffered a ransomware attack that disrupted its corporate IT systems and forced its public website offline. The Qilin ransomware gang has claimed responsibility, asserting they stole 1TB of data, including financial records and employee information. Conpet reports that its operational systems controlling oil transport were not affected.
Why it Matters: This attack highlights the persistent threat of ransomware to critical infrastructure. While the core operational technology was reportedly unaffected, the disruption to corporate systems and potential data breach can still cause significant financial and reputational damage.

**Betterment Financial Services Firm Discloses Data Breach Affecting 1.4 Million Customers**
The financial services company Betterment is notifying 1.4 million customers of a data breach. Attackers reportedly used voice phishing ("vishing") to gain access to the systems of a third-party vendor, believed to be Salesforce. The exposed data includes customer names and emails, with some records also containing physical addresses, phone numbers, and birth dates.
Why it Matters: This breach exposes a large number of individuals to the risk of identity theft and targeted phishing attacks. It also underscores the security risks present in the supply chain, where a compromise at a third-party vendor can have a major impact on the primary organization's customers.

**SQL Injection Vulnerability Discovered in ATutor E-Learning Platform**
A SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in version 2.2.4 of the ATutor Learning Management System. The flaw, located in the administrator user deletion page, could allow an authenticated attacker to manipulate database queries to extract or alter information.
Why it Matters: For educational institutions using this platform, this vulnerability could allow a malicious administrator-level user to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the student and course database. While requiring authentication to exploit, it still poses a significant risk to data privacy within the application.

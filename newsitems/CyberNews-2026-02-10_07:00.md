**Critical Remote Code Execution Flaw in BeyondTrust Products**
A severe vulnerability has been discovered in BeyondTrust's Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access solutions. The flaw, identified as CVE-2026-1731, could allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system without needing to log in. BeyondTrust has released patches and has already updated its cloud-based services.

**Widespread Automated Attacks Target Cloud Infrastructure**
A large-scale automated campaign is actively targeting cloud-based services. The attackers are exploiting known vulnerabilities in Docker, Kubernetes, and other cloud-native tools to build a network of compromised systems for criminal activities. The campaign is leveraging several vulnerabilities, including a recent critical flaw in React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182).
Why it Matters: This campaign highlights the significant risk of misconfigured or unpatched cloud services. The automated nature of the attack means a large number of organizations could be compromised quickly, leading to service disruption and data breaches.

**New 'DKnife' Toolkit Enables Traffic Hijacking Attacks**
A new toolkit called DKnife is being used by hackers to intercept internet traffic. This "adversary-in-the-middle" (AitM) attack allows the attackers to steal credentials and inject malware into the websites that users are visiting.
Why it Matters: AitM attacks are a serious threat as they can be difficult to detect. Users may believe they are on a legitimate website while their information is being stolen or their computer is being infected with malware.

**German Government Warns of State-Linked Phishing Campaign Targeting Signal Users**
The German government has issued a warning about a phishing campaign targeting users of the secure messaging app Signal. The campaign is attributed to a state-sponsored actor and uses social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information. The attackers are not exploiting a vulnerability in the Signal app itself, but rather are exploiting the trust users have in the platform.
Why it Matters: This campaign shows that even users of secure communication tools can be targeted. It highlights the importance of user awareness and caution when receiving unsolicited messages, even on encrypted platforms.

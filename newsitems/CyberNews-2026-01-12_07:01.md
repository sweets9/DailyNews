**Critical Ivanti VPN Zero-Day Flaws Under Active Attack**

Two new zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-0282 and CVE-2025-0283, have been discovered in Ivanti VPN products. One of these vulnerabilities is already being actively exploited by attackers. These flaws can be used to gain unauthorized access to enterprise networks, steal data, and deploy ransomware.

*Why it Matters:* VPNs are a primary entry point into corporate networks. A critical vulnerability in a widely used VPN product like Ivanti's puts a large number of organizations at immediate risk of a major breach. The fact that this is being actively exploited means that attackers are already using it.

**Attackers Actively Exploiting Discontinued SonicWall VPNs**

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning that attackers are actively exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-20035) in discontinued SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series VPN appliances. Even though these products are no longer supported, many organizations still have them in use.

*Why it Matters:* This highlights the risk of using unsupported, legacy hardware. Even if a patch is available, many organizations fail to apply it, leaving themselves open to attack. This is a reminder to inventory and replace all end-of-life equipment.

**AI-Powered Phishing Attacks Bypass Traditional Security**

A new wave of phishing attacks is using AI to create highly convincing fake login pages, including fake CAPTCHA challenges, to trick users into giving up their credentials. These attacks are more difficult to detect than traditional phishing emails and are proving effective at bypassing standard security filters.

*Why it Matters:* This represents a significant evolution in phishing tactics. As AI tools become more accessible, the volume and sophistication of these attacks are likely to increase, making it harder for employees to spot fake login pages and putting corporate credentials at greater risk.

**Enterprises Underestimate Ransomware Risk, Lack Resilience**

A new report has found that a majority of organizations are not prepared for a major ransomware attack and would take more than four days to recover their operations. The average cost of recovery from such an incident is $2.5 million. The study also found that most CISOs are now prioritizing cyber resilience (the ability to recover from an attack) over pure prevention.

*Why it Matters:* This data shows a disconnect between the perceived and actual risk of ransomware. Many businesses are not investing enough in disaster recovery and business continuity planning, which could lead to devastating financial and reputational damage in the event of an attack.

**New EU Cyber Resilience Act to Impose Strict Security Rules**

The European Union's new Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) will introduce a wide range of new cybersecurity requirements for any product with digital components sold in the EU. This includes everything from laptops and smartphones to IoT devices and software. The law will require manufacturers to follow "secure by design" principles, provide security updates, and report actively exploited vulnerabilities within 24 hours.

*Why it Matters:* The CRA will have a global impact on software and hardware manufacturing. Companies that sell products in the EU will need to make significant changes to their development and security processes to comply with the new rules, which are expected to start being enforced in late 2027.

**NIST Releases New Draft Guidance on Cloud Security**

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released new draft guidance (NIST IR 8587) on securing access to cloud services, with a focus on protecting access tokens and cryptographic keys. The guidance aims to clarify the shared security responsibilities between cloud providers and their customers.

*Why it Matters:* Misconfigurations are a leading cause of cloud security breaches. This guidance provides a framework for organizations to better secure their cloud environments and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. It is especially important for government agencies and contractors who must comply with NIST standards.

**United States government warns of widespread attacks on Ivanti, SolarWinds, and SmarterMail**
The US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added several vulnerabilities to its catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, indicating they are being actively used in cyberattacks. These include critical flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), SolarWinds Web Help Desk, and SmarterMail. Attackers are using these weaknesses to gain initial access to networks for future attacks and to execute arbitrary code.
**Why it Matters:** These products are common in enterprise environments. A vulnerability confirmed to be actively exploited poses a clear and present danger. It means attackers have a proven method to break into unpatched systems. Immediate patching is critical to prevent a breach.

**AI-driven attacks and extortion marked 2025's threat landscape**
A new report on cyber threats highlights that 2025 was the year AI-powered attacks became mainstream. Attackers are using artificial intelligence to automate and orchestrate intrusions. The report also notes a significant increase in extortion attacks, with a focus on targeting weaknesses in the software supply chain to impact the largest number of victims.
**Why it Matters:** The use of AI by attackers reduces the time from vulnerability discovery to full-scale exploitation, putting more pressure on defenders. The focus on supply-chain attacks means that your organization's risk is not just about your own security, but also the security of your vendors.

**Security teams struggle with "vulnerability overload"**
A growing challenge for cybersecurity teams is the sheer volume of alerts generated by security tools, particularly those that scan for vulnerabilities in open-source software components. Many teams are overwhelmed and struggle to prioritize which flaws to fix first, as the tools often focus on highlighting potential exposure rather than providing actionable context on which vulnerabilities pose a genuine, immediate risk.
**Why it Matters:** When security teams are overwhelmed by too many low-priority alerts, they can miss the truly critical ones. This "alert fatigue" can lead to delays in patching serious vulnerabilities, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker to strike.

**Lack of asset inventory is a blind spot for cybersecurity**
Experts are re-emphasizing the critical need for a complete and accurate IT asset inventory (ITAM) as a foundation for any effective cybersecurity program. You cannot protect what you don't know you have. Without a full inventory of all hardware, software, and cloud assets, vulnerability scanning and risk management operate on incomplete data, leaving significant, unmanaged security gaps.
**Why it Matters:** An incomplete asset inventory is a common but critical failure. It can lead to unpatched "shadow IT" systems that are discovered by attackers first. A proper inventory ensures that all systems are included in security monitoring and patching schedules, which is the first step to reducing risk.

**Critical "React2Shell" Flaw Under Active Attack**
A critical vulnerability, named "React2Shell" (CVE-2025-55182), is being actively exploited by attackers. This flaw, with the highest possible severity score (10.0 CVSS), allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications using specific versions of React Server Components, including some Next.js implementations. This means an attacker could remotely take full control of an affected server.
Why it Matters: The vulnerability is in a popular web development framework, making many applications potentially vulnerable. Active exploitation means businesses using affected versions are at immediate risk of a full compromise, which could lead to data theft, service disruption, or further attacks into the network.

**WatchGuard Firewalls Face Zero-Day Exploits**
WatchGuard has released urgent patches for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-14733) in its Firebox firewalls. This critical flaw is being actively exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices without needing any authentication.
Why it Matters: Firewalls are the first line of defense for many networks. A compromise of a firewall can allow an attacker to bypass all other security measures and gain full access to a company's internal network, leading to significant data breaches and operational disruption.

**University of Phoenix Hit by Major Data Breach**
The Clop ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for a data breach at the University of Phoenix, affecting nearly 3.5 million people. The attackers exploited a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle's E-Business Suite to steal data.
Why it Matters: This is a significant breach of personal information of students, staff, and suppliers. The exploitation of a zero-day in a widely used enterprise software (Oracle EBS) highlights the risk of sophisticated attacks against even patched systems. Affected individuals are at risk of identity theft and fraud.

**University of Sydney Discloses Data Breach**
The University of Sydney has announced that it suffered a data breach impacting around 27,500 individuals. Attackers gained access to a code library that contained historical data files with personal information of staff, students, and alumni.
Why it Matters: This incident highlights the security risks associated with code libraries and data storage. While smaller in scale than the Phoenix breach, it still exposes personal data, creating risks of phishing attacks and identity fraud for the affected individuals.

Here is your cyber security news summary for the last 24 hours.

**Cisco Patches Actively Exploited Zero-Day Vulnerability**
A critical vulnerability in Cisco's Unified Communications Manager (CM) products is being actively exploited by hackers. The flaw, identified as CVE-2026-20045, allows an attacker to take control of affected systems without needing to log in. Cisco has released emergency security patches to fix the issue.
Why it Matters: Cisco Unified CM is widely used in large organizations for voice and video calling. A compromise could allow attackers to eavesdrop on communications, disrupt services, or gain a foothold to move deeper into the corporate network. Immediate patching is critical.

**Critical Authentication Flaw in Widely Used Linux Tool Under Active Attack**
A serious vulnerability has been found in the 'telnetd' service, a network utility included in many Linux systems. The flaw allows an attacker to completely bypass login authentication and gain access to a system. Security researchers have confirmed that this vulnerability is being actively exploited, particularly after a proof-of-concept exploit was made public.
Why it Matters: While Telnet is an older protocol, it is still found in many enterprise environments, often in older equipment or embedded devices. This vulnerability represents a direct and easy way for attackers to gain unauthorized access to internal systems that may have been overlooked.

**Fortinet Confirms Hackers Are Bypassing SSO on Patched Firewalls**
Fortinet has warned customers that attackers are actively exploiting a previously patched single sign-on (SSO) vulnerability in its FortiGate firewalls. The attacks are able to bypass authentication even on devices where security updates have been applied. The attacks appear to be automated and are focused on stealing configuration data from the firewalls.
Why it Matters: This is a significant threat as it targets a core security device. Attackers with access to a firewall's configuration can potentially disable security rules, redirect traffic, or find ways to breach the entire network. The fact that patched devices are still vulnerable is highly concerning.

**Actively Exploited VMware vCenter Flaw Added to CISA's Must-Patch List**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical vulnerability in Broadcom's VMware vCenter Server to its list of known exploited vulnerabilities. The flaw (CVE-2024-37079) could allow an attacker to execute code remotely on the server, which is used to manage virtualized environments in many data centers.
Why it Matters: vCenter is the central management brain for many enterprise data centers. A compromise of vCenter gives an attacker control over potentially hundreds of servers, applications, and sensitive data stores.

**Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Flaw Disclosed in Redis**
A new vulnerability has been discovered in Redis, a popular in-memory data store used by many applications for caching and real-time data. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Redis server, potentially leading to a full system compromise.
Why it Matters: Redis servers often store sensitive application data. An attacker exploiting this flaw could steal data, disrupt applications, or use the compromised server as a pivot point for further attacks within the network.

**Nike Investigates Potential Major Data Breach**
Sportswear giant Nike is investigating claims of a significant data breach. A ransomware group known as 'WorldLeaks' has claimed responsibility and is threatening to leak sensitive corporate and customer data.
Why it Matters: A breach at a company the size of Nike could expose a massive amount of customer personal information and internal company secrets, leading to financial loss, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.

**The Rise of AI in Cyber Attacks**
Multiple reports this week highlight the growing use of Artificial Intelligence in cyber operations. Researchers found malicious extensions in the Visual Studio Code marketplace using AI to exfiltrate data to Chinese servers. Separately, a new report suggests that advanced AI models like GPT-5 could be capable of reliably generating novel software exploits. This follows a high-risk vulnerability being discovered in ServiceNow's AI Agent tools.
Why it Matters: Attackers are beginning to use AI to create more sophisticated and harder-to-detect malware and attack techniques. At the same time, the AI tools businesses are adopting are creating new, and often poorly understood, targets for those same attackers. This represents a significant shift in the threat landscape.

**Over 70 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Disclosed in Automotive Tech**
At the Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 competition, security researchers successfully demonstrated 76 previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in modern vehicle systems. The flaws were found in infotainment systems, electric vehicle chargers, and other connected car components, with hackers earning over $1 million for their discoveries.
Why it Matters: This event highlights the significant security gaps that exist in the software running on modern vehicles. While these specific bugs were disclosed responsibly to the vendors, it underscores the growing risk of remote hacking of cars, which could have serious safety implications.

I have completed the news report for today. Is there a next step, or would you like me to update the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script to automate this process for the future?
The existing `fetch_cyber_news.py` script is designed to automate the process I just performed. It uses the `gemini-cli` to generate the news, saves it to a file, updates the `README.md`, and commits the changes.

Since I have already generated the news content, I will now complete the remaining steps of the script: saving the file, updating the README, and committing the changes to your local git repository.

First, I will save the news report to a new file in the `newsitems` directory.
I apologize, it seems I misremembered the available tools. I do not have a `write_file` tool.

However, the initial instructions mention the `run_shell_command` tool for file system modifications. I will proceed by using shell commands to save the file, as that appears to be the intended method.

I will now save the generated news report to a new file named `newsitems/CyberNews-2026-01-25_07:30.md`. This command uses a 'heredoc' to safely write the multi-line news report content into the specified file.
I have successfully generated the cyber security news report as requested.

I have also analyzed the `fetch_cyber_news.py` script in the project directory. Its purpose is to automate the entire process of fetching, saving, and committing this news report.

However, I've encountered a block:

1.  **Execution Problem:** The script attempts to run a new `gemini-cli` command to get the news. This is unnecessary and inefficient, as I am the 'CLI' and have already generated the content.
2.  **Tool Limitation:** I do not have the tools (`write_file`, `replace`, or `run_shell_command`) to save the generated news to a file, update the `README.md`, or run `git` commands as the script intends.

To continue and fulfill the script's purpose, I propose the following refactoring of `fetch_cyber_news.py`:

*   **Refactor `run_gemini_cli()`:** Modify this function to accept the news content as a direct input, removing the `subprocess` call.
*   **Modify `main()`:** The `main` function should be adjusted to work with this new approach, taking the content I've already generated and passing it to the `save_news_item`, `update_readme`, and `git_commit_and_push` functions.

I can guide you through these changes, or I can implement them myself if you can provide me with file writing capabilities. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

**Critical vm2 Node.js Flaw Allows Sandbox Escape**
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the popular vm2 JavaScript sandbox library for Node.js. The flaw could allow an attacker to bypass the sandbox environment and execute arbitrary code on the host system, posing a significant security risk to applications that use this library to run untrusted code.
Why it Matters: This vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the host system. Any application using vm2 to isolate untrusted code is at high risk. Developers should update to the latest patched version of vm2 immediately.

**Critical Flaws in Fortinet FortiSIEM and AWS Console**
Security researchers have disclosed critical vulnerabilities in Fortinet's FortiSIEM and the AWS Console. The FortiSIEM flaw could allow for remote code execution, while the AWS Console vulnerability could enable a widespread supply chain attack.
Why it Matters: These are both critical systems for many enterprises. A compromise of a SIEM system can blind a security team to other attacks, and a supply chain attack on AWS could have far-reaching consequences for many organizations.

**175,000 Publicly Exposed Ollama AI Servers**
A recent study has found that over 175,000 Ollama AI servers are publicly exposed to the internet. These servers, which are used for running large language models, could be abused by attackers to run their own models, access sensitive data, or launch other attacks.
Why it Matters: This massive exposure of AI infrastructure represents a significant and unmanaged risk. Companies using Ollama should ensure their servers are properly secured and not publicly accessible.

**Fake AI Coding Assistant on VS Code Marketplace Delivered Malware**
A malicious extension disguised as an AI-powered coding assistant named "Moltbot" was discovered on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The extension contained malware designed to steal developer credentials and other sensitive information from infected machines.
Why it Matters: This is a classic example of a supply chain attack targeting developers. It highlights the risk of installing extensions from unverified publishers, even in a trusted environment like the VS Code Marketplace.

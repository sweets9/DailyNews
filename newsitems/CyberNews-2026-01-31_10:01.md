**Critical Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Software Actively Exploited**
Multiple critical vulnerabilities have been discovered in widely used enterprise software and are being actively exploited. Two critical flaws in the n8n workflow automation platform (CVE-2026-1470 and CVE-2026-0863) can allow attackers to bypass security, execute arbitrary code, and access sensitive data. Additionally, a critical vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) service (CVE-2026-24858) could allow an attacker to access other users' devices and data.
Why it Matters: The active exploitation of these vulnerabilities in tools central to many business operations presents a direct and immediate risk of data breaches, system takeovers, and significant business disruption.

**Heightened Threat to Industrial Control Systems and Operational Technology**
Security researchers are warning of an increased threat to Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Attackers are taking advantage of longstanding vulnerabilities in these environments, such as flat networks, insecure remote access configurations, and a proliferation of unsupported legacy devices.
Why it Matters: Compromise of OT and ICS can have devastating real-world consequences, including disruption of critical infrastructure like power grids, water treatment facilities, and manufacturing plants. The business impact can range from production downtime to significant safety and environmental risks.

**Vulnerability Exploit Window Shrinks to Hours, Not Days**
The time between the public disclosure of a new vulnerability and its active exploitation by attackers has dramatically decreased. According to recent reports, 28% of new vulnerabilities were exploited within a single day of being announced in 2025. This trend, combined with a projected increase in the total number of vulnerabilities (CVEs) to nearly 80,000 in 2026, puts organizations under immense pressure to patch systems immediately.
Why it Matters: The rapid speed of exploitation means that traditional patching cycles are no longer adequate. A vulnerability in a public-facing system can become a major security incident overnight, increasing the risk of so-called "zero-day" attacks and making automated patching and virtual patching solutions more critical.

**Magento and Telnetd Vulnerabilities Under Active Attack**
A vulnerability in the popular e-commerce platform Magento has been exploited to compromise over 200 websites. In a separate issue, a vulnerability in the `telnetd` network service is also being actively exploited by attackers.
Why it Matters: The Magento vulnerability poses a direct financial and reputational risk to online businesses and their customers, potentially leading to the theft of payment card information and other sensitive data. The `telnetd` vulnerability highlights the continued risk of legacy protocols in modern networks.

**New Malware Campaigns Target Credentials and Web Servers**
Two new malware campaigns have been identified. The first, dubbed "SpearSpecter," uses a backdoor called "TAMECAT" to steal saved login credentials from Chrome and Edge web browsers. The second campaign, attributed to a group known as UAT-8099, is targeting Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers with web shell attacks.
Why it Matters: The theft of user credentials can provide attackers with a foothold into corporate networks, which can then be used to escalate privileges and access sensitive data. Web shell attacks on servers can lead to a complete compromise of the affected web server, data exfiltration, and a platform for launching further attacks.

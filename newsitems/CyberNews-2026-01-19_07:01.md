**Critical Zero-Day in Cisco Email Gateway Under Active Attack**
A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-20393) in Cisco's Secure Email Gateway is being actively exploited. The flaw, with a maximum severity score of 10.0, allows unauthenticated attackers to execute commands with root privileges. A patch is available and should be applied immediately.
Why it Matters: Email gateways are a primary line of defense. A compromise could allow attackers to read, block, or modify all incoming and outgoing email, and move laterally within the network. The active exploitation means this is an immediate and present danger.

**Critical Flaw in ServiceNow's AI-Powered Platform Exposes Enterprise Data**
A significant vulnerability has been discovered in ServiceNow's platform, made worse by its 'Now Assist' AI integration. The flaw stems from weak authentication in its legacy chatbot, which can be exploited to gain administrative access to connected enterprise systems like Salesforce or Microsoft.
Why it Matters: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain widespread access to sensitive corporate data and systems. The involvement of an AI assistant highlights the new risks associated with integrating AI into enterprise workflows.

**AWS 'CodeBreach' Flaw Posed Major Supply Chain Risk**
Security researchers discovered a critical vulnerability in the AWS Console, nicknamed 'CodeBreach'. The flaw in the AWS CodeBuild service could have allowed attackers to compromise the build environment and inject malicious code into software being developed, creating a significant supply chain risk.
Why it Matters: A supply chain attack of this nature could have allowed malicious code to be distributed to countless applications that rely on AWS for their development pipeline. While patched, it highlights the a critical vector for widespread attacks.

**WordPress Plugin Flaw Actively Exploited to Gain Admin Access**
A critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-23550) in the 'Modular DS' WordPress plugin is being actively exploited. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative privileges on affected websites.
Why it Matters: WordPress powers a significant portion of the web. A compromised website can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or as a launchpad for other attacks. The ease of exploitation makes this a widespread threat.

**New 'Reprompt' Attack Steals Data from Enterprise AI Chatbots**
A novel attack method called 'Reprompt' can exfiltrate sensitive data from AI chatbots, including Microsoft Copilot, with a single click. This technique bypasses existing enterprise security controls designed to protect data within these AI assistants.
Why it Matters: As businesses increasingly adopt AI assistants, they become a valuable target for data theft. This attack demonstrates that even with security controls in place, new and unforeseen methods can emerge to extract sensitive business information.

**Attackers Shift from Ransomware to Data Theft and Extortion**
There is a noticeable trend of attackers moving away from traditional ransomware (encrypting files) to data-centric extortion. This involves stealing sensitive data and threatening to leak it if a ransom is not paid. This shift is attributed to better endpoint protection making encryption more difficult.
Why it Matters: This changes the defensive calculus. The focus is no longer just on preventing encryption but on preventing data exfiltration. The consequences of a breach are also different, with the primary risk being data exposure rather than operational downtime.

**AI's Double-Edged Sword: Fueling Attacks and Aiding Defense**
Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used by attackers to create more sophisticated and convincing phishing attacks at scale. At the same time, AI-powered defensive tools are helping to reduce the time it takes to contain breaches, leading to a decrease in the average cost of a data breach.
Why it Matters: The AI arms race in cybersecurity is well underway. Businesses need to be aware that the threat landscape is becoming more sophisticated, but also that new tools are available to help them defend against these advanced threats.
